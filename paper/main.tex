\section{Introduction}
Brain development and function depend on numerous regulatory processes,
including the flow of cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF). CSF is a clear liquid produced by the choroid plexus
and the fluid flows through the ventricular system and subarachnoid space.
By transporting growth factors, nutrients, neurotransmitters and metabolites
and removing waste products, CSF regulates brain development and homeostasis.
Disturbance of the CSF circulation can lead to brain disorders, such as
hydrocephalus where accumulation of CSF often requires emergency surgical treatment. 

Motion of CSF occurs through multiple physiological processes,
including the beating motion of motile cilia lining the ventricular walls,
CSF secretion by the choroid plexus, and pressure gradients generated
by the cardiac cycle, respiration, and bodily movement. Motile cilia
are microscopic hair-like structures that beat in a metachronal wave
pattern to mediate fluid flow. Due to their microscopic size, ranging
from 6 to 15 microns, the cilia contribute to flow primarily at the surface
of the brain ventricles. In contrast, fluid flow induced by the 
cardiac and respiratory cycles account for the bulk flow in the brain
ventricles~\cite{Vinje2019RespiratoryMeasurements},
as well as the CSF flow in the perivascular spaces.

To date, it remains poorly understood how cilia contribute to the
overall fluid flow and solute transport within the brain.
These questions have been challenging to tackle due to technical
limitations. Notably, cilia are microscopic and beat at high
frequencies ranging from 10 to 30 Hz, while other fluid dynamic
processes in the brain are slower and span larger volumes, making
cilia dynamics challenging to monitor in vivo. Until now, most studies have
analyzed one physical mechanism at a time, especially in mammals.
For instance, studies using brain explants have convincingly shown
that cilia generate complex flow patterns at the surface of the brain
ventricles; however, they failed to identify the role of pressure
gradients associated with respiration and cardiac pulsations in CSF flow
and the accompanying transport. Similarly, while MRI technology can measure CSF movement
in humans, it cannot detect the microscopic movements of cilia to
understand their impact in the large human brain. Consequently, we
lack a comprehensive understanding of how cilia contribute to CSF
motion and solute transport, and whether cilia dysfunction will
alter CSF composition and lead to brain disorders. This is particularly
important since ventricular enlargement, known as hydrocephalus,
is observed in animal models and humans with motile cilia deficiency,
indiciating that the cilia play a crucial role for healthy brain functioning.

The technical limitations of studying cilia-mediated flow and transport opens the
possibility of mathematical modeling and computational investigations. Numerous previous studies
have focused on modeling the interaction between single or several cilia and surrounding
fluids~\cite{Guo2020SimulatingGeometries, Ruvalcaba2021NumericalTree, Smith2009MathematicalFluids,
Cui2019NumericalMethod, Cui2022AFlow}.
Others considered applications such as ciliary transport of mucous and particles in
airways~\cite{Fulford1986Muco-ciliaryLung, Ramirez-SanJuan2020Multi-scaleArrays},
propulsion and locomotion of ciliated organisms~\cite{BLAKE1974MechanicsMotion,
Jahn1972LocomotionProtozoa, Brennen1977FluidFlagella},
oxygen regulation in coral reefs~\cite{Pacherres2022CiliaryProduction},
and cilia-mediated flow in the brain~\cite{Siyahhan2014FlowVentricles,
Yoshida2022EffectVentricles, Salman2022ComputationalEmbryo, Thouvenin2020OriginCanal}.
These simulation studies have provided valuable insights on how cilia mediate complex
biological flows, and how cilia may contribute to tissue physiology.

In this study, we combined computational and experimental approaches to investigate
the role of motile cilia in intraventricular CSF flow and transport.
First, we computed flow patterns and simulated solute transport with a computational model. To
this end, we used the geometry of the zebrafish larval brain ventricles,
for which we have detailed knowledge of cilia properties and CSF motion velocities
and frequencies. Notably, this early developmental stage allows us to simplify our model
by omitting CSF secretion, which starts at later stages,
while still being well-conserved with mammals. 
Next, we validated our computation model with experimental data by monitoring in vivo
the dynamics of a photoconvertible fluorescent protein Dendra2
expressed within the brain ventricles.
Our results show that diffusion plays a major role in the transport of small solutes,
whereas cilia majorly contribute to the movement of larger particles.
We also found that the location of cilia, as well as the ventricular geometry, greatly
impact solute distribution. Altogether, our work presents a computational
framework together with new concepts of how cilia contribute to distribution of molecules and
particles within the brain ventricles.

\section{Computational Methods}
\subsection{Image-based computational geometries of zebrafish brain ventricles}
To model flow and transport in zebrafish larval brain ventricles, we generated a
3D representation of the brain ventricular walls using confocal imaging data of a zebrafish embryo
injected intraventricularly with a 70 kDa dye at 2 dpf~\cite{Olstad2019CiliaryDevelopment}. 
From the imaging data, we constructed a computational mesh of the ventricles (\Crefpanels{fig:fig1}{d}).
The interior volume was meshed with fTetWild~\cite{Hu2020FastWild}. 
The standard mesh consisted of 132 134 tetrahedral cells and had a
maximal (minimal) edge length of 14.9 \textmu m (4.68 \textmu m). 
At 2 dpf, the ventricular system consists mainly of 3 cavities: the telencephalic (anterior),
the di-/mesencephalic (middle) and the rhombencephalic (posterior) ventricles,
which are connected by interventricular ducts. 
Parts of the ventricular surfaces were marked to be lined with
motile cilia (\Crefpanels{fig:fig1}{d}, magenta markers)~\cite{Olstad2019CiliaryDevelopment}.

The morphology and geometry of the brain ventricles vary across zebrafish
individuals, and under physiological and pathological conditions~\cite{Olstad2019CiliaryDevelopment}. 
Motivated by an interest in how ventricular geometry impacts solute distribution,
we also consider four variations in the geometry (cross-sectional area
reduction in parentheses):
by shrinking the fore-mid brain connection (66 \%), 
the middle ventricle (33 \%), the mid-hind brain connection (43 \%), and all three simultaneously.
We used Blender~\cite{Community2018BlenderPackage} to modify the brain ventricles geometry.

\subsection{Computational CSF dynamics}
The beating motion of the cilia generates CSF flow with steady rotational
structures~\cite{Olstad2019CiliaryDevelopment}
within the brain ventricles (\Crefpanels{fig:fig1}{a--c}).
In addition, cardiac pulsations induce pulsatile CSF flow.
We model this flow of CSF in the brain ventricles by the time-dependent,
incompressible Stokes equations which read as follows.
Find the CSF velocity $\uu = \uu(\xx, t) = (u_x(\xx, t), u_y(\xx, t), u_z(\xx, t))$
and the CSF pressure $p = p(\xx, t)$ for $\xx \in \Omega$ and time $t>0$, such that
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
      \rho \pdifft{\uu} - \nabla \cdot \bsig &= \mathbf{0}
      \quad \text{in } \Omega,\\
      \nabla \cdot \uu &= 0
      \quad  \text{in } \Omega,
  \end{align}
  \label{eq:stokes_eqs}% 
\end{subequations}%
where the stress tensor is defined as $\bsig(\uu, p) = 2\mu\beps(\uu) - p\mathbf{I}$
and $\beps(\uu) = \frac{1}{2}\left(\nabla \uu + (\nabla\uu)^T\right)$ is the strain-rate tensor. 
Bold-face characters denote vectors or tensors, and $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity tensor in three dimensions.
Furthermore, $\rho=1000 \ \mathrm{kg/m^3}$ is the CSF density
and $\mu=0.70 \ \mathrm{mPa\cdot s}$ is the dynamic viscosity
of the CSF~\cite{Bloomfield1998EffectsFluid}.
We introduce the tangential traction $\bsigpar$ as the
tangential component of the traction $\hat{\bsig}=\bsig\nn$:
\begin{equation*}
    \bsigpar = P_{\nn}(\hat{\bsig}) = (\mathbf{I} - \nn\otimes\nn)\hat{\bsig},
\end{equation*}
where $\nn$ is the outer unit normal of the boundary surface $\Gamma = \partial\Omega$,
and $P_{\nn}(\rr)$ is the tangential projection of a vector $\rr$ onto $\Gamma$.
We consider three types of boundary conditions:
(i) \emph{tangential traction} (no flow normal to the boundary
$\uu \cdot \nn = 0$ with a stress $\btau$ applied tangentially on the boundary $\bsigpar = \btau$),
(ii) \emph{normal pressure} (a pressure $\Tilde{p}$ applied in
the normal direction: $(\mu\nabla\uu - p\mathbf{I})\nn = \Tilde{p}(t)\nn$),
and (iii) \emph{free slip} (no flow normal to the boundary
$\uu \cdot \nn = 0$ and no tangential traction $\bsigpar = {\bf 0}$).
Unless noted otherwise, the free-slip condition is applied on the
boundary. We assume that the system starts at rest: $\uu(\xx, t=0) = \mathbf{0}$.

To study the impact of the motile cilia and the cardiac pulsations on the CSF flow,
we consider the following computational flow scenarios,
each predicting a CSF flow velocity $\uu$ and CSF pressure $p$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item A \emph{baseline} flow model representing a wild-type zebrafish including 
    contributions both from the cilia forces and the cardiac pulsations.
    In this scenario, we apply the tangential traction $\btau$ on the cilia boundary
    $\Gc$ and prescribe the normal pressure $\Tilde{p}$ on the anterior/posterior boundary $\Gp$. % Model 0/Model C

    \item A \emph{cilia-only/no-cardiac} flow model including contributions from the
    cilia forces but no cardiac pulsations.
    Here, we apply the tangential traction $\btau$ on the cilia boundary $\Gc$.
    In the absence of cardiac flow, the anterior/posterior boundary $\Gp=\emptyset$. % Model I/Model A

    \item A \emph{cardiac-only/no-cilia} flow model including contributions from the
    cardiac pulsations but no cilia forces.
    Here, we set the tangential traction to zero on the cilia boundary
    $\Gc$, while prescribing the normal pressure $\Tilde{p}$ on the
    anterior/posterior boundary $\Gp$.  % Model II/Model B
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Cilia-driven flow}
On the ciliated regions of the ventricle walls $\Gc$ (\Crefpanels{fig:fig1}{d}, magenta markers),
we impose a constant-in-time tangential traction $\bsigpar=\btau$ to represent the net forces
of the cilia acting on the CSF.
We set $\btau(\xx, \rr) = \tau \lambda(\xx) P_{\nn}(\rr)$, where the function $\lambda(\xx)$
and the sign of the vector $\rr=\pm(1, 0, 1)$ varies depending on the
cilia region (see~\Cref{subsec:appendixA1}).
Both $\rr$ and the value $\tau=0.65$ mPa were chosen by 
model calibration using experimental data~\cite{Olstad2019CiliaryDevelopment}.
The data indicate speeds proximate to the ventricular walls of $27.4 \pm 5.4$ \textmu m/s and
$2.6 \pm 0.6$ \textmu m/s in the dorsal and ventral regions of the middle ventricle, respectively.
In the anterior ventricle, the speeds were estimated at $4.7 \pm 1.3$ \textmu m/s.
We calibrated $\tau$ heuristically by comparing these experimental velocity values
with the simulated, maximum velocity magnitude.

\subsubsection{Flow induced by cardiac pulsations}
To generate a cardiac-induced pulsatile flow inside the brain ventricles, we set $\Tilde{p}(t)=0$ and
$\Tilde{p}(t)=-A\sin{\omega t}$ on anterior and posterior parts, respectively, of the
boundary $\Gp$~(\Crefpanels{fig:fig1}{d}, blue markers).
Based on a measured cardiac frequency of $f=2.22$ Hz~\cite{Olstad2019CiliaryDevelopment},
the angular cardiac frequency $\omega=2\pi f=6.97$ rad/s.
The amplitude $A=1.5$ mPa determines the magnitude of the pulsatile flow,
and was calibrated based on experimental data~\cite{Olstad2019CiliaryDevelopment}.
Similar to $\tau$, the amplitude $A$ was chosen by comparing experimental and simulated velocities.
Particle tracking data of pulsatile motion was used to determine the contributions of the
cardiac pulsations to the velocity magnitude,
as compared to the effect of cilia motion on the flow (cf.~\Cref{sec:appC_particle_transport}).

\subsection{Computational model of solute transport after photoconversion}
We simulate transport of photoconverted proteins within the brain ventricles by
modeling transport of a solute with concentration $c(\xx, t)$ for $\xx\in\Omega$ and
time $t > 0$ by the advection-diffusion equation
\begin{equation}
    \pdifft{c} + \nabla\cdot\JJ = 0 \quad \text{in } \Omega,
    \label{eq:adv_diff_strong}
\end{equation}
where the total concentration flux $\JJ$ is assumed to consist of an advective and a diffusive flux:
\begin{equation*}
    \JJ = c\uu - D\nabla c .
\end{equation*}
Here, $\uu$ is the CSF velocity field, governed by the Stokes equations~\Cref{eq:stokes_eqs},
and $D$ is the molecular diffusion coefficient of the solute.
Initially, we set $c(\xx, 0)=0$ for all $\xx\in\Omega$.
The ventricular walls are assumed to be impermeable (admitting \emph{no flux}: $\JJ\cdot\nn=0$),
except at the anterior/posterior boundary $\Gp$.
At the anterior/posterior boundary, we permit the solute concentration to be advected into
and out of the domain in a manner that ensures conservation of mass
(see~\Cref{subsec:adv_diff_eq_weak_form} for details).

To computationally represent protein photoconversion in a region
$\Omega_{\mathrm{pc}} \subset \Omega$ (corresponding to ROI 1),
we prescribe a given time-dependent value to the solute concentration in this region. 
Mimicking the experimental protocol, we consider the dorsal part of the
diencephalic ventricle as the subdomain $\Omega_{\mathrm{pc}}$, and set
\begin{equation}
  c(\xx, t)=\frac{\log{(1+t/a)}}{\log{(1+T/a)}},
  \quad \xx \in \Omega_{\mathrm{pc}}, \quad t > 0.
\label{eq:photoconversion_curve}
\end{equation}
The value $a=65$ was chosen to fit the fluorescence intensity curve
observed in the physical photoconversion experiments.

\subsection{Estimation of diffusion coefficients via the Stokes-Einstein relation}
Motivated by an interest in molecules that are significant in neural development,
we study the transport of molecules resembling the Dendra2 Fluorescent Protein (Dendra2)
used in this study, the Starmaker+Green Fluorescent Protein (STM-GFP) reported in
Jeong~\emph{et al.}~\cite{Jeong2024TheZebrafish}, and exosomes.
To estimate the diffusion coefficients of these, when not
available in the literature, we use the Stokes--Einstein relation
\begin{equation}
    D = \frac{k_B T}{6\pi \mu R},
    \label{eq:D_stokes_einstein}
\end{equation}
which is an expression for the diffusion coefficient of a spherical
molecule suspended in a viscous fluid~\cite{Einstein1905UberTeilchen}.
In~\Cref{eq:D_stokes_einstein}, $k_B = \num{1.38e-23}$ J/K is the Boltzmann constant,
$T = 310$ K is the absolute temperature, $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the
solvent (in this case the CSF), and $R$ is the radius of the molecule.
For the exosomes, we calculate $D$ using~\Cref{eq:D_stokes_einstein}
with $R=150$ nm, which represents exosomes at the larger end of the
scale~\cite{Moghassemi2024ExtracellularDecade}.
Hence this radius covers the slowest diffusing exosomes,
a choice made because smaller exosomes would have diffusion coefficients
similar to the other molecules we consider.
For STM-GFP, we estimated the diffusion coefficient by extrapolating
the experimentally observed diffusion coefficient of
GFP~\cite{Swaminathan1997PhotobleachingDiffusion, Potma2001ReducedCells},
assuming that if $D$ scales with $1/R$ according to~\Cref{eq:D_stokes_einstein},
$D$ would scale with the cube root of the molecule mass~\cite{Goodhill1997DiffusionGuidance}.
The resulting diffusion coefficients used in the simulations
are $D_1$ (exosomes), $D_2$ (STM-GFP) and $D_3$ (Dendra2)~(\Cref{tab:diff_coeff_table}).

%Implicit in this approach is the assumption that the proteins all have the same density.

    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Quantities of interest}
We calculate the mean solute concentrations
\begin{equation}
    \cbar_i(t) = \frac{1}{|\Omega_i|}\int_{\Omega_i} c(\xx, t)\,\dx,
    \label{eq:c_mean_i}
\end{equation}
in the six regions of interest (ROIs) $\Omega_i$ ($i = 1, \dots, 6$)
as functions of time, where $|\Omega_i|$ is the volume of
the domain $\Omega_i$. The dynamics of ROI 1 follows directly
from~\Cref{eq:photoconversion_curve}. In addition,
we report time-to-threshold: the time $\hat{t}_i$ when
the mean concentration $\cbar_i$ first exceed a threshold
value $\hat{c}_i$. We use $\hat{c}_i=0.25$ for ROI 1--4 and
$\hat{c}_i=0.10$ for ROI 5--6.

To evaluate the relative importance of advection and
diffusion as transport mechanisms, we consider the Péclet number
\begin{equation*}
    \mathrm{Pe} = \frac{\mathrm{diffusion \ timescale}}{\mathrm{advection \ timescale}}
    = \frac{t_d}{t_a} = \frac{L_p^2/D}{L_p/U_p} = \frac{L_p U_p}{D}.
\end{equation*}
Thus, if $\mathrm{Pe} > 1$, transport is dominated by advection,
and if $\mathrm{Pe} < 1$ transport is dominated by diffusion.
Here, $L_p$ and $U_p$ are characteristic length and velocity scales,
respectively, and $D$ is the solute diffusion coefficient.
In calculating a global Péclet number, we use $L_p=600$ \textmu m, the approximate length of the
ventricles geometry along the rostrocaudal ($x$-) axis.
We use a mean velocity $\overline{U}$ as the characteristic velocity $U_p$.
The mean velocity $\overline{U}$ is calculated by first averaging the velocity in space:
\begin{equation*}
    \overline{u}^2 = \frac{1}{|\Omega|}\int_{\Omega}\uu\cdot\uu\dx,
\end{equation*}
and then averaging $\overline{u}$ in time over one cardiac cycle.
To assess the assumption that inertial forces are negligible compared to
viscous forces in the CSF flow, such that the flow is governed by the Stokes equations,
we also compute the Reynolds number
\begin{equation*}
    \mathrm{Re} = \frac{\mathrm{inertial \ forces}}{\mathrm{viscous \ forces}} = \frac{\rho U_r L_r}{\mu},
\end{equation*}
with $L_r$ and $U_r$ as length and velocity scales characteristic of the flow. 

%-----DISCRETIZATION AND MODEL IMPLEMENTATION-----%
\subsection{Numerical approximation of the Stokes equations}
The Stokes equations~\Cref{eq:stokes_eqs} are discretized with a finite element method
in space, while in time, we employ a first-order implicit Euler discretization.
We set the timestep size $\Delta t = 0.02252$ s such that 20 timesteps represent one cardiac cycle.
For the spatial discretization, we use piecewise linear Brezzi-Douglas-Marini (BDM)
elements for the velocity.~\cite{Brezzi1985TwoProblems, Nedelec1986AIR3}
The BDM elements have degrees of freedom associated with integral moments of the
velocity component normal to the facets of elements,
thus we enforce the impermeability condition $\uu\cdot\nn=0$ strongly.
We impose the boundary conditions for both the tangential traction $\bsigpar$ and
the normal pressure $\Tilde{p}(t)$ weakly.
For the pressure, we use piecewise constant (zeroth order discontinuous Galerkin (DG)) elements.
The resulting total number of degrees of freedom at each time step is 943 820.
The element combination $\mathrm{BDM}_1$--$\mathrm{DG}_{0}$ yields a non-conforming
discretization scheme for the Stokes equations~\cite{Stenberg1989SomeEquations}.
To ensure stability of the scheme, continuity in tangential velocities on interior facets
is weakly enforced with a penalty parameter $\gamma=10$~\cite{Hong2016AEquations}.
Since the divergence of the velocity space is a subspace of the pressure space for this scheme,
the divergence-free condition of the velocity is satisfied exactly on each
element, ensuring mass conservation.~\cite{Boffi2008FiniteProblem} 

\subsection{Numerical approximation of the advection-diffusion equation}
The advection-diffusion equation~\Cref{eq:adv_diff_strong} is discretized
with a first-order implicit Euler method in time, and a first-order,
symmetric interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (DG)
method in space~\cite{Arnold1982AnElements}, chosen due to its favorable
conservation properties.
To accurately approximate the solute concentrations even
in the presence of strong advection (high Péclet numbers),
we use an upwind scheme for the velocity when calculating the
advective flux~\cite{Patankar2018NumericalFlow}.
As for the flow equations, we use a timestep size of
$\Delta t = 0.02252$ s. We simulate transport for 1900 cardiac cycles,
with a final time of simulation $T = 856$ s.
A DG penalty parameter $\alpha = 25$ was chosen to ensure stability of the method. 

\subsection{Solution strategy and software implementation}
Owing to the one-way coupling between the velocity field $\uu$
and the concentration $c$, the governing equations for the
CSF flow and the concentration can be solved sequentially when modeling solute transport.
For the cilia-only/no-cardiac flow scenario, the velocity quickly reaches steady-state since
the viscous forces dominate the inertial forces.
In this case, we first solve the steady-state Stokes equations~\Cref{eq:stokes_eqs}
for $\uu$ and $p$, and then use the velocity field $\uu$ as input when solving
the advection-diffusion equation~\Cref{eq:adv_diff_strong}.
For the other flow scenarios, the Stokes equations are solved for one
period of the pulsatile cardiac motion. The solution of this one period
is then used periodically as input for the advection-diffusion equation.

The numerical solution schemes for the Stokes equations and the
advection-diffusion equation were implemented and solved numerically with
DOLFINx~\cite{dolfinx2023preprint} with petsc4py~\cite{Dalcin2011ParallelPython}
as linear algebra backend.
A direct solver using MUMPS~\cite{Amestoy2011Mumps} was used to solve the
linear systems resulting from the discretized Stokes equations.
For the discretized advection-diffusion equation, we used an iterative
linear solver based on GMRES~\cite{Saad1986GMRES:Systems} with block Jacobi
preconditioning~\cite{Jacobi1845UeberGleichungen}. We discretize the time-dependent 
diffusion equation (without advection) and use the assembled linear system matrix
as the preconditioner matrix for the advection-diffusion problem.
Numerical experiments verified the accuracy of the model implementation
(\Cref{sec:appB_verification}). The simulation code is openly

\section{Experimental Methods}
\subsection{Zebrafish maintenance, genotyping and strains in photoconversion experiments}
The animal facilities for zebrafish~(\emph{danio rerio}) are approved by the
Norwegian Food Safety Authority (NFSA, Mattilsynet).
The zebrafish were maintained in accordance with the guidelines set by the
NFSA and the European Communities Council Directive.

The larval and adult zebrafish were raised under standard husbandry
conditions at 28.5°C in a Techniplast Zebtech Multilinking system.
The fish tanks were kept at constant pH 7.0 and 685 \textmu S with a
14/10 hr light/dark cycle.
From fertilization to 3 dpf, larvae were maintained in egg
water (1.2 g marine salt and 0.1\% methylene blue in 20 L reverse osmosis (RO) water)
and subsequently transferred to artificial fish water (AFW)
(1.2 g marine salt in 20 L RO water). The zebrafish lines used in the experiments were
\emph{ccdc103(dnaaf19)\textsuperscript{tn222a}}
(\emph{schmalhans (smh)})~\cite{Jau-NianChen1997Left-rightZebrafish}
and \emph{Tg(gfap:Gal4FF)\textsuperscript{nw7Tg}}~\cite{DiazVerdugo2019Glia-neuronSeizures},
\emph{Tg(5xuas:Signal-Dendra2)\textsuperscript{nw21Tg}}.
Animals were in the pigmentless \emph{nacre\textsuperscript{b692}}
(\emph{mitfa\textsuperscript{-/-}})~\cite{JamesA.Lister1999NacreFate} background.

Wholemount in vivo live imaging and photoconversion
experiments were performed with zebrafish larvae at 2 days post-fertilization (dpf) stage obtained from inbreeding of heterozygous
\emph{smh\textsuperscript{+/-};Tg(gfap:Gal4FF);Tg(5xuas:Signal-Dendra2})
adult animals, as described in D'Gama~\emph{et al.}~\cite{DGama2024Cilia-mediatedBrain}.
Controls consisted of either wild-type (\emph{smh}\textsuperscript{+/+})
or \emph{smh}\textsuperscript{+/-} heterozygous zebrafish from the same breeding.
The mutants were identified based on their curved body~\cite{Jau-NianChen1997Left-rightZebrafish}.

For genotyping, genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from clipped fins of anesthetized adult
fish using 100 \textmu L of PCR lysis buffer (containing 1M tris pH 7--9, 0.5 M EDTA,
tritonX-100, and Proteinase K 0.1 mg/ml) overnight at 50°C.
To stop the lysis reaction, the samples were heated to 95°C for 10 minutes
and then centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 2 minutes.
The supernatant containing gDNA was utilized for KASP assays-based analysis.
The gDNAs were diluted (1:2) with water, and 3 \textmu L of the diluted gDNA was
used to perform the KASP assay following the guidelines of the manufacturer (LGC Biosearch Technologies™).
For each sample well, the master mix contained: 5 \textmu L of master mix; 0.14
\textmu L of assay mix; 1.86 \textmu L of RO water.

\subsection{Generation of transgenic line to study CSF and transport dynamics} 
To generate a transgenic line expressing the photoconvertible protein Dendra2 in
the brain ventricles, we fused the open reading frame (ORF)
of the neuropeptide y (npy) signal peptide
(\emph{npy}: ENSDARG00000036222, Q1LW93) to the N-terminal of
zebrafish codon optimized Dendra2 DNA sequence.
The DNA sequence was synthesized with EcoR1 enzyme sites at the 5’ and
3’ ends (GenScript Biotech) and inserted into the
pT2MUASMCS vector~\cite{Asakawa2008GeneticZebrafish}
through restriction enzyme cloning (GenScript Biotech)
to generate the 5xuas:Signal-Dendra2 plasmid DNA.

A volume of 2 nl of a mixture of the plasmid DNA (60 pg) and tol2 mRNA (10 pg)
was microinjected into one-cell stage embryos to generate the transgenic line,
as described in Jeong~\emph{et al.}~\cite{Jeong2024TheZebrafish}. The injected
embryos were raised to adulthood (F0).
Germline-transmitted founder zebrafish were identified by breeding with
multiple Gal4 transgenic lines. Stable F1 embryos expressing the Gal4-driven
Dendra2 signals were screened and raised to adult zebrafish.

\subsection{Wholemount zebrafish in vivo live time-lapse imaging and photoconversion of Dendra2}
Two dpf larval zebrafish were anesthetized in 0.013\% MS222
(Ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate, Sigma) in AFW and
mounted laterally in 1.5\% low melting agarose in a Flurodish (VWR, FD35PDL-100),
to obtain a lateral view of the brain ventricles. After the
fish were positioned in the agarose, the dish stood for 5 min to allow the agarose to solidify.
After solidification, AFW containing 0.013\% MS222 was added,
and then the fish were transferred to the confocal microscope (LSM880 Examiner, Zeiss)
and imaged using a 20x water-immersion objective (Zeiss, NA 1.0, Plan-Apochromat)
at room temperature.

The time-lapse images were acquired in a single plane, covering the
telencephalic, diencephalic and rhombencephalic ventricles simultaneously,
with a frequency of 0.37--0.38 Hz (2.60--2.68 sec / frame). The size
of the images was $1024\times400$ pixels. In total, 300 images were acquired per fish.
The first 10 images were scanned without photoconversion to obtain a
baseline value of fluorescence intensity, and the next 290 images were
scanned while performing photoconversion. 

For photoconversion, ``Bleaching" and ``Region" in the ZEN software
were used. A 405 nm laser was focused into a circular area (diameter: 16 \textmu m, scan 0.77 \textmu sec/pixel)
of the dorsoposterior diencephalic ventricle with 100\% laser power.
The laser was illuminated in the area repeatedly between each scanning.
After imaging, the fish health was checked and only data from healthy fish were analyzed.
Data were collected and analyzed from three separate experiments,
with a total of 8 controls and 6 mutants.

\subsection{Photoconversion data analysis}
All data analysis was performed in MATLAB and the codes are available in
the repository of this article~\cite{zenodo-link-to-all-code}\fixme{Add repo link.}.

Following import of the image data, the photoconverted channel
was aligned to correct for drift in $x,y$ directions using previously
developed codes~\cite{Reiten2017Motile-Cilia-MediatedComputations, Ringers2023NovelEpithelia}.
Only stable recordings were further analyzed. 
To increase the signal to noise ratio, the images were downsampled by
a block average using a resampling factor of 6 (using the MATLAB function blockproc).
The change of fluorescence $($$(F-F_0)/F_0$, hereafter referred to as
$\Delta F$$)$ was calculated for each pixel at each time point of the data.
Here, the value $F_0$ is the average fluorescence intensity for the
baseline (the first 10 time-lapse images) acquired before photoconversion. 

To identify the time needed to pass a certain threshold value,
$\Delta F$ values were first smoothened.
The first timepoint when values surpassed the threshold was reported
per pixel (in the downsampled images).
A mask for the image was generated using the green (not photoconverted)
channel and calculated on the block-averaged data based on the intensity
being higher than 1.5x median intensity of all the frames.

To obtain $\Delta F$ values for a region of interest (ROI), ROIs were
first drawn on the aligned and block-averaged time series.
Six ROIs were drawn manually: ROI 1 around the location of photoconversion,
and ROIs 2--6 in different regions of the ventricular system.
The pixel values of the fluorescence intensity within one ROI were
averaged for each time point, and the relative change $\Delta F$ calculated with this averaged value.
To normalize the data with respect to photoconversion efficiency, the
$\Delta F$ curves for all ROIs were divided by the $\Delta F$ values
obtained for ROI 1 at the end of the experiment,
so that $\Delta F$ values for the photoconverted site ROI 1 ranged from
zero to one. Finally, we averaged the $\Delta F$ data from controls and from mutants.
We report these mean values together with a one-standard deviation error band.

\subsection{Intraventricular injection of microbeads and particle tracking}
To recover the flow fields shown in~\Crefpanels{fig:fig1}{b, c}, we carried out
particle tracking in a larval zebrafish injected with fluorescent beads with a procedure described in detail in previous work~\cite{Olstad2019CiliaryDevelopment}.
Anesthetized 2 dpf zebrafish were injected with 1 nl of a mixture containing 0.1\% w/v fluorescent beads
(SPHERO Fluorescent Yellow Particles 1\% w/v, F = 0.16 mm) diluted
in 7.5 mg/ml 70 kDa rhodamine B isothiocyanate-dextran (RITCdextran; Sigma-Aldrich, R9379)
dissolved in artificial CSF. Artificial CSF composition was as follows:
124 mM NaCl, 22 mM D-(+)-Glucose, 2.0 mM KCl, 1.6 mM MgSO\textsubscript{4} $\cdot$ 7 H\textsubscript{2}O,
1.3 mM KH\textsubscript{2}PO\textsubscript{4}, 24 mM NaHCO\textsubscript{3},
2.0 mM CaCl\textsubscript{2} $\cdot$ 2 H\textsubscript{2}O.
The needles used for the injections were pulled with a
Sutter Instrument Co. Model P-2000 from thin-walled glass
capillaries (1.00 mm; VWR) and cut open with a forceps.
A volume of 1 nl of the solution was injected with a pressure injector
(Eppendorf Femtojet 4i) in the rostral rhombencephalic ventricle.
The pressure and time were calibrated for each needle using a 0.01 mm calibration slide.

Following injection, the zebrafish was directly placed under the confocal
microscope and 1200 images were acquired at a frequency of 13.1 Hz.
A single optical section was obtained. Particle tracking was done using
TrackMate~\cite{Tinevez2017TrackMate:Tracking} in Fiji/ImageJ~\cite{Schindelin2012Fiji:Analysis}
and plotted using MATLAB, as described in Jeong~\emph{et al.}~\cite{Jeong2022MeasurementTelencephalon}.
The parameters for TrackMate were as follows.
The DoG detector was used with the settings: threshold: 2.0, with
median filtering; radius: 2.0, with subpixel localization.
Next, the Simple LAP tracker was used with settings: max frame gap: 2;
alternative linking cost factor: 1.05; linking max distance: 5.0; gap closing max distance: 2.0;
splitting max distance: 15.0; allow gap closing: true; allow track splitting:
false; allow track merging: false; merging max distance: 15.0; cutoff percentile: 0.9.
Only the particle tracks with at least 30 data points, while simultaneously
covering a distance of at least 8.8 \textmu m, were plotted in~\Crefpanels{fig:fig1}{b, c}.


%%--------------RESULTS--------------%%
\section{Results}
\subsection{Motile cilia induce flow compartmentalization within the brain ventricles}

We model the compartmentalized and pulsatile CSF flow observed in vivo~(\Crefpanels{fig:fig1}{b, c})
by the Stokes equations, and solve the equations numerically using a finite element method.
To characterize CSF flow patterns predicted by
computational fluid dynamics within the brain ventricles, we first
consider the simulated CSF velocity and pressure when only modeling
cilia motion, disregarding cardiac pressure pulsations. The
bidirectional traction induced by the motile cilia
inherently leads to a partial compartmentalization of the ventricular
system, with large-scale vortex structures in the anterior and middle
ventricles~(~\Crefpanels{fig:fig1}{e}). The highest velocities ($26.5$ \textmu m/s)
occur in the vicinity of the dorsal cilia in the middle ventricle. 

To examine the effect of cardiac pressure pulsations,
we next consider a no-cilia model variation. In this scenario, the vortex structures
generated by the ciliary motion vanish. The simulated CSF
flow is pulsatile as a result of the sinusoidal pressure gradient (~\Crefpanels{fig:fig1}{f, g}),
with a peak velocity magnitude of $4.8$ \textmu m/s. At each time instant, the flow
is unidirectional, with CSF initially flowing rostrocaudally (positive $x-$axis) before changing
direction to caudorostral in the middle of the cardiac cycle.

Finally, we consider the baseline model, simulating flow driven by both cilia
and cardiac pulsations. We observe persistent flow features,
with vortex-structures in the anterior and middle ventricles
and directional flow in the posterior ventricle (~\Crefpanels{fig:fig1}{h--j},
\fixme{Supplementary video 1}). These characteristic patterns suggest
that the flow in the anterior and middle ventricles is majorly driven
by cilia, while the cardiac pressure pulsations dominate
within the posterior ventricle and in the ducts connecting the ventricular
compartments. Over one cardiac cycle, the CSF flow
speed reaches up to 27.7 \textmu m/s, dorsally in the posterior part
of the middle ventricle. This peak is attained at the time instant
coinciding with the time of peak caudal cardiac pulsatile flow, since 
both the tangential traction induced by the cilia and the pulsatile
pressure-driven flow are aligned with the rostrocaudal 
axis. Using the observed maximum velocity magnitude and choosing the height of
the middle ventricle ($110$ \textmu m) as a characteristic length
scale yields a Reynolds number $\mathrm{Re} \approx 0.004$,
justifying the assumption of Stokes flow. In summary, the computational
CSF flow model reproduces the flow features observed
in vivo~\cite{Olstad2019CiliaryDevelopment}.

\subsection{Ventricular solute transport is advection-dominated for larger molecules}
We next explore the impact of these CSF flow patterns and magnitudes
on solute transport within the brain ventricles.
To this end, we simulate the distribution and evolution
of different solutes subjected to photoconversion within a region of
interest in the dorsal region of the middle ventricle (ROI 1)
(~\Crefpanels{fig:fig2}{a}). We consider the spread of
a solute concentration with a given molecular diffusion coefficient,
corresponding to exosomes ($D_1 = 1.63 \times 10^{-12}$ m$^2$/s),
a circa 90 kDa protein STM-GFP ($D_2 = 5.75 \times 10^{-11}$ m$^2$/s),
and the 26 kDa photoconvertible protein  Dendra2 ($D_3 = 1.15 \times 10^{-10}$ m$^2$/s).
As expected, transport occurs more
rapidly with increasing diffusion coefficient. Interestingly, the
distribution patterns differ between the solutes.
For the smallest diffusion coefficient, representing
exosomes, the advective transport by the CSF flow dominates diffusion
(\Crefpanels{fig:fig2}{b}). The vortex structures of the velocity field
carry over into the concentration field, indicating that transport
along the streamlines is more rapid than the diffusion across the
streamlines. The balance between diffusion and advection shifts with
increasing diffusion coefficients: the CSF flow structures become more
obfuscated, and the solute spreads more uniformly throughout the
ventricular geometry (\Crefpanels{fig:fig2}{c, d}). Notably, the
smaller solutes with higher diffusion coefficients spread more quickly
to regions distal to the photoconversion site.
\begin{figure}%[H]

    with diffusion coefficients $D_1$, $D_2$ and $D_3$ for eight time instants covering the

    Slices are taken in the $xz$-plane ($y=0.140$ mm, the center of the geometry).

    concentration field slice at the last time instant.

    threshold value of $0.25$ (ROIs 2-4) or $0.10$ (ROIs 5, 6) in each simulation setup.
    Note that there is no bar for $D_1$ in ROI 6, because the threshold value was never exceeded.}\label{fig:fig2}
\end{figure}

To quantify the transport of solute, we plot the profile of the mean
concentrations $\cbar_i(t)$ as functions of time
(\Crefpanels{fig:fig2}{e--g}) and
the times $\hat{t}$ when the mean concentrations $\cbar_i$ first exceed
a threshold value $\hat{c}$ (\Crefpanels{fig:fig2}{h})
in 6 ROIs (\Crefpanels{fig:fig2}{a}).
The dynamics at the site of photoconversion (ROI 1)
is logarithmic and follows from imposing \Cref{eq:photoconversion_curve}.
For ROIs 2--6, we observe faster kinetics with higher diffusion coefficients
(\Crefpanels{fig:fig2}{e--g}),
which results in smaller times-to-threshold
(\Crefpanels{fig:fig2}{h}).
For all three diffusion coefficients, the dynamics of ROI 5
is significantly delayed compared to ROI 2--4,
and ROI 6 is the slowest. Notably, for $D_1$ the mean concentration
in ROI 6 is close to zero at the end of simulation.
To quantify the balance of advection versus diffusion as transport mechanisms,
we calculate the Péclet numbers $\mathrm{Pe}_1=519$,
$\mathrm{Pe}_2=14.7$ and $\mathrm{Pe}_3=7.4$ for $D_1$, $D_2$ and $D_3$, respectively.
Since $\mathrm{Pe}>1$, this indicates that advection is the
dominant transport mechanism on a global scale.
 
\subsection{Validation of the simulations with experimental data}
To validate our computational model, we performed photoconversion experiments
in transgenic zebrafish larvae expressing the secreted Dendra2 in their brain ventricles.
Our photoconversion protocol consisted of the acquisition of a baseline,
before localized exposure to a UV laser (at the ROI 1 location)
that converts Dendra2 from a green to a red emitting fluorescent protein. 
To quantify the transport of photoconverted proteins, we measured and
calculated the change in fluorescence intensity $\Delta F = (F(t)-F_0)/F_0$
over time (\Crefpanels{fig:fig3}{a},
$F_0$ being the average fluorescence at baseline). 

We obtained very similar kinetics curves (\Crefpanels{fig:fig3}{a, b})
and time-to-threshold values (\Crefpanels{fig:fig3}{c, d}) when comparing our
experiments (\Crefpanels{fig:fig3}{a, c}) with
simulation (\Crefpanels{fig:fig3}{b, d}).
Importantly, since the initial condition of the simulation is a mean concentration of zero,
the mean concentration $\cbar$ can be interpreted as the change in mean concentration and
is thus a similar metric to $\Delta F$.
The final values of $\cbar$ in our simulations 0.76, 0.72, 0.82, 0.56 and 0.35
(ROIs 2--6, respectively)
are generally higher than the mean experimental values 0.63, 0.71, 0.67, 0.29 and 0.18 for $\Delta F$.
Notwithstanding similar dynamics, we observe small differences between the experiments and simulation.
For instance, transport in ROIs 2--6 is faster in the simulation and reaches higher final values.
Moreover, the $\cbar$ profiles of ROIs 3--4 are opposite order in
the simulations as compared to the experiments.
Despite observing small differences, the in vivo experiments and
simulations are similar enough to convincingly validate the model.

\subsection{Absence of ciliary motion affects local protein distribution}
Since CSF flow is highly disturbed in the absence of motile cilia, we
want to assess the impact of cilia motion on solute distribution. To this end,
we measured the movement of photoconverted Dendra2 signal
in control and motile-cilia mutant (\emph{smh}) zebrafish .
By plotting the means of $\Delta F$ (\Crefpanels{fig:fig4}{a})
and the time to threshold
across the control and mutant cohorts (\Crefpanels{fig:fig4}{b}),
we identified a significant
difference in Dendra2 distribution in ROIs 2 and 4, but not in ROIs 3, 5, and 6. In ROIs 2 and 4,
which measure Dendra2 distribution downstream of the photoconversion site,
we observed a slower increase of fluorescence intensity,
resulting in $45\%$ (ROI 2) and $25\%$ (ROI 4)
higher mean times-to-threshold in the \emph{smh}
mutants compared to controls (\Crefpanels{fig:fig4}{b}). 

Next, to identify whether our model would recapitulate these findings,
we simulate protein transport by using the only-cardiac/no-cilia flow model 
and compare it with the baseline model
(both cilia and cardiac motion) (\Crefpanels{fig:fig4}{c}).
Similar to our experiments, we observe slower dynamics in simulations for ROIs 2 and 4,
but small changes for ROIs 3 and 6.
Interestingly, the difference was even greater for the simulations,
with the times-to-threshold in ROI 2 and 4 being 90\% and 34\% higher
in the absence of cilia-mediated flow.
Moreover, ROI 5 exhibits very different $\cbar$ profiles for the two
configurations in our computational model,
but not in our experimental data.
Altogether, our findings identify that diffusion plays an important
role for solute movement to regions upstream in the cilia flow fields or to distant ventricles.

\subsection{Loss of cilia motility in specific subpopulation slows down transport}
We previously identified three distinct ciliated cell lineages in the
zebrafish larval brain~\cite{Olstad2019CiliaryDevelopment, DGama2025MotileBrain}.
To identify the role of these lineages on CSF transport, we simulate transport
upon region-specific cilia paralysis by modifying the boundary conditions
of the CSF flow model. Three cilia-covered regions were considered separately:
the telencephalic (anterior) ventricle, and the dorsal and ventral parts
of the diencephalic (middle) ventricle (\Crefpanels{fig:fig5}{a}).
The cilia tangential traction boundary condition is for each case
changed to a free-slip boundary condition in the paralyzed region,
prescribing zero tangential forces to
represent absence of cilia motion.
We simulate CSF flow modeled by the Stokes equations with the
modified boundary conditions and use the resulting
velocity fields in transport simulations.

The CSF velocities are most strongly
affected when removing cilia in the dorsal diencephalic ventricle,
as the maximum velocity magnitude drops from 27.7 \textmu m/s to 8.0 \textmu m/s.
In vivo, these cilia generate the strongest flow at
this developmental stage of the fish~\cite{Olstad2019CiliaryDevelopment}.
In contrast, removing telencephalic and ventral diencephalic cilia has minimal
impact and results in maximum speeds of 27.7 \textmu m/s or 27.2 \textmu m/s, respectively.
Of the total tangential force exerted by the cilia, ventral cilia in the middle ventricle
contribute with 34\%, while the dorsal cilia exert 52\% of the total tangential
force~(\Crefpanels{fig:fig5}{b}). The magnitude of the force contributions are thus
more similar than the difference in their impact on the maximum velocity magnitudes.

Changes in the transport dynamics of Dendra2 are most prominent when removing the dorsal cilia
in the diencephalic ventricle. All ROIs (except ROI 1, where we impose the photoconversion curve)
exhibit changes in the dynamics of $\cbar$ (\Crefpanels{fig:fig5}{c}).
Compared to the baseline model results, we observe a slower increase and lower final concentration
in the middle and anterior ventricles (ROIs 2--5),
and more rapid transport to the posterior ventricle (ROI 6).
In contrast, removal of telencephalic cilia does not alter the evolution of the
mean concentration $\cbar$ with time (\Crefpanels{fig:fig5}{c}).
Finally, without ventral cilia in the diencephalic ventricle,
more solute spreads towards the anterior ventricle (ROI 5) and
less solute spreads towards the posterior ventricle (ROI 6).
\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{graphics/figure5_compare_cilia_modifications.png}

    \textbf{c.} Mean concentration $\cbar(t)$ for the six regions of interest (ROIs) in the three 
    paralysis scenarios considered. The region named in the legend is the region
    where we modify the cilia tangential traction boundary condition to a free-slip condition
    in the CSF flow model.}
    \label{fig:fig5}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Modification of ventricles geometry impacts protein distribution}
Variations in ventricular morphology impact CSF flow patterns.
To assess how ventricular morphologies influence solute distribution,
we consider four alternative brain ventricles meshes:
one where the duct connecting the anterior and middle ventricles is constricted
(66 \% reduction in cross-sectional area);
one where the duct connecting the middle and posterior ventricles is constricted
(33 \% reduction);
one where the middle ventricle is shrunk in the lateral direction (43 \% reduction);
and the combination of the above three modifications (\Crefpanels{fig:fig6}{a}).
We simulate CSF flow in the modified geometries with the baseline flow model
and use the resulting velocity field to simulate transport of Dendra2
(\Crefpanels{fig:fig6}{b}).

Constricting the connection between the anterior and middle ventricle leads to
slower transport to the anterior ventricle (ROI 5),
and a slightly higher mean concentration in ROIs 2--4 and 6, compared to the original geometry.
On the other hand, constricting the duct connecting the middle and the posterior ventricle
leads to less transport into the posterior ventricle (ROI 6),
and slightly more transport towards the anterior ventricle (ROI 5).
Faster transport to the anterior ventricle (ROI 5) and slower transport to the
posterior ventricle (ROI 6) is also the case for the geometry with a shrunk middle ventricle.
Additionally, for the latter configuration, the transport upstream of CSF flow towards the
ventral-posterior region of the middle ventricle (ROI 3) is slowed down.
For the mesh where all three ventricles are modified,
we observe higher retention of solute in the middle ventricle (ROIs 2--4),
while both the anterior and the posterior ventricles (ROIs 5 and 6) have lower mean concentrations.
Altogether, our results show that the geometry and width of the ventricular ducts matter
for solute transport. This may explain why we observed larger differences
in the cilia-deficient computational model compared to the experimental data in
\Cref{fig:fig4}, as the model and the fish have different duct diameters.

\section{Discussion}
In this study, we have presented a computational model of CSF flow and solute transport within the brain ventricles.
We used the larval zebrafish brain ventricles since its geometry,
flow components and kinetics are well described, thereby allowing us to validate
our simulation experimentally. Nevertheless, our computational framework can be adapted to and implemented in
other ventricular systems in the future, given that the flow parameters of such systems
are comprehensively resolved. By imposing tangential traction and normal pressure
on the CSF flow, we were able to reproduce flow fields with similar features
as observed experimentally. The prominent flow features were vortex-structured flow,
mediated by cilia, and pulsatile flow, mediated by the cardiac cycle.

Using the simulated CSF flow, we modeled solute transport by an advection-diffusion equation.
The transport results compared well with experimental data performed in vivo in zebrafish.
Then, by using a computational model as well as zebrafish mutants with paralyzed cilia,
we identified that even though advection by cilia is dominant,
diffusion plays a significant role in protein transport.
Finally, we reported how local cilia paralysis and ventricular geometries
affect solute distribution. Altogether, we present not only new findings on the role of
diffusion and advection in intraventriuclar transport, but also provide a novel framework to
study CSF flow and transport in complex geometries.

\subsection{The roles of advection and diffusion in intraventricular solute transport}
To investigate the roles of advection and diffusion in solute transport, we quantified transport
based on changes in fluorescence intensity $\Delta F$ (experiments) and
mean concentration $\cbar$ (simulations) as functions of time.
Even though we identified very similar dynamics in simulations and
in vivo experiments, the dynamics of the simulations were generally
more rapid and resulted in higher total amounts of solute.
Differences between experiments and simulations may relate to
ventricular size, as we showed that modifying the geometry of the interventricular ducts
impacts solute distribution, and the geometry used for the computational model was larger
than geometries used in experiments. Alternatively, dissimilarities in results may relate
to the way we defined the photoconversion site (ROI 1) in the simulations,
since the volume of the photoconversion region determines
the total amount of solute and thereby the rate of transport. Another source
of discrepancy may relate to the permeability of the ventricular wall,
which we have ignored in our simulation. Reports have shown that the
neuroepithelium lining the walls of brain ventricles in 24 hour old zebrafish
is permeable to dyes smaller than 70 kDa~\cite{Chang2012AnNeuroepithelium}.
Since Dendra2 is around 26 kDa in size~\cite{Gurskaya2006EngineeringLight} and
thus under this reported limit, one could assume that Dendra2 may
leak out of the brain ventricles over the time spans we consider
and render the dynamics slower.

Nevertheless, our results convincingly show that
intraventricular transport of proteins depends on a balance of advection and diffusion.
While advection is the strongest transport mechanism on a global scale for
Dendra2 (global Péclet number 7.4), diffusion is balancing out
advection especially for shorter distances and for regions devoid of motile cilia activity.
Indeed, we identified that the diffusion coefficient had a greater impact on transport to
regions located upstream in the CSF flow field (ROI 3) or in different ventricles (ROIs 5--6),
than the regions located downstream of cilia-mediated flow (ROI 2). 

Meanwhile, we identified that transport of larger molecules
(thus with smaller diffusion coefficients),
such as 150 nm exosomes, are almost entirely dependent on advection.
Indeed, there was essentially zero solute in the posterior ventricle at the
final simulation time (around 850 s), a ventricle where transport is largely driven
by diffusion due to the absence of motile cilia.
For $D_1$, an estimate of the diffusion timescale $t_d=L^2/D_1$ over a distance
$L=200$ \textmu m from the middle to the posterior ventricle is approximately 24500 s.
Advective transport by the mean velocity $\overline{U}=1.41 \ \mu$m/s over the same
distance would happen on a timescale of the order of $t_a=L/\overline{U}=141$ s.
Comparing this with the minuscule values of $\cbar_6$ after simulating transport
with $D_1$ for 850 s, one can conclude that if advection
played a role in transporting solute from the photoconversion site in the middle ventricle
to the posterior ventricle, values of $\cbar_6$ would be higher than those observed.

\subsection{Effects of cilia motility and ventricular morphology}
To gain further insights into how CSF flow and intraventricular transport depend on cilia
motility and ventricular morphology, we manipulated certain
parameters in our models. First, we investigated how complete loss of cilia motility
impacted the transport dynamics. Simulations with a cardiac-only/no-cilia lead to
slower transport when compared to the baseline model that included cilia. Especially
the middle-ventricular region downstream of CSF flow (ROI 2) and the anterior ventricle (ROI 5)
experienced substantially increased times-to-threshold. We also observed
slower dynamics in the rest of the middle ventricle (ROIs 3 and 4), whereas the
posterior ventricle (ROI 6) was unaffected by the loss
of cilia motility, indicating that transport from the middle to the posterior ventricle is
purely driven by diffusion. We also performed photoconversion experiments on cilia mutant
zebrafish larva (\emph{smh}), observing statistically signifcant slower transport in 
ROIs 2 and 4. The results provide not only confidence in that our computational model
well represents the physics, but also valuable quantification of the impact of cilia motility
on intraventricular transport. Interestingly, a previous simulation study of reduced cilia motility
also observed a drastic reduction in CSF mixing in specific regions of the brain
ventricles~\cite{Yoshida2022EffectVentricles}, similar to our results. Since impaired brain 
clearance of tracers has been demonstrated in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus
patients~\cite{Eide2020MagneticHydrocephalus}, cilia-enhanced mixing in the brain might be
fundamental to physiological transport within the brain.

Next, we paralyzed cilia in specific regions of
our model. We identified that the cilia in the dorsal middle ventricle contribute
the most to solute distribution, which aligns well with the fact
that these cilia generate the strongest flow field in vivo~\cite{Olstad2019CiliaryDevelopment}
and in our model. In contrast, removing the ventral cilia in the middle ventricle
did not greatly impact flow dynamics, despite these cilia contributing a third of
the total force exerted by the cilia. However, removing ventral cilia in the middle ventricle
lead to reduced transport towards the posterior ventricle,
meanwhile increasing transport towards the anterior ventricle,
as the ventral cilia help induce flow towards the posterior ventricle.
Removing the cilia in the anterior ventricle did not affect the transport.

With an interest in assessing the impact of ventricular morphology on solute transprot,
we simulated transport on modified ventricular geometries.
Notably, shrinking ducts reduced interventricular solute movement, while shrinking
the middle ventricle reduced diffusive transport upstream of the flow field.
We previously identified large inter-individual variation in ventricular size and
CSF velocities between larva at given developmental stages and throughout
development~\cite{Olstad2019CiliaryDevelopment, DGama2025MotileBrain, Jeong2024TheZebrafish}.
Our results suggest that these two parameters, CSF velocities and ventricular size,
may well co-vary and explain the variation in the two.

These simulation studies demonstrate that our model is flexible and allows in silico
testing of further hypotheses on the effects of ciliated
lineages and ventricular morphology on CSF flow and intraventricular transport.
We envision that our framework will be useful as a basis for future analyses of
CSF dynamics in more complex geometries and also other animal species and humans.

\subsection{Computational model assumptions and boundary conditions}
To model CSF, we employed slip boundary conditions at the ventricular walls,
contrasting the classical choice of a noslip boundary condition.
The use of slip boundary conditions is motivated by experimental observations of the
flow field in zebrafish embryo brain ventricles, both previously and in this work, in which
the fluid velocity increases towards the
wall~(\Crefpanels{fig:fig1}c)~\cite{Olstad2019CiliaryDevelopment}. Slip boundary
conditions allow for this behavior, in contrast to a noslip condition where the velocity
has to go to zero at the wall.

As opposed to a couple of previous continuum model simulation studies of
cilia-mediated flow where cilia were represented by body
forces,~\cite{Siyahhan2014FlowVentricles, Thouvenin2020OriginCanal}
we chose to model the cilia as a force
exerted tangentially on the boundary.
We deem this a good representation of the real nature of cilia,
since they are microscale structures confined to the ventricular walls that
generate flow through collective motion. Furthermore, it avoids the need of mesh
refinement near the ciliated boundaries in the case that a
body force were to be applied in a cilia layer of depth around
5 \textmu m~\cite{Salman2022ComputationalEmbryo}.

The ciliated boundaries in our CSF flow model are regionally homogeneous,
whereas in reality, cilia populate the ventricle walls in a
heterogeneous manner~\cite{Olstad2019CiliaryDevelopment}. Heterogeneous
arrangement of cilia, both in location, beating direction and beating frequency,
has been shown to enhance particle clearance in airway cilia arrays
in mice~\cite{Ramirez-SanJuan2020Multi-scaleArrays}.
Incorporating spatial arrangement heterogeneity in our model could possibly
result in different transport timescales,
but we would not expect notable changes to the general trends of the macroscopic
transport that we study here, since the effects of introducing heterogeneous spacing
of cilia would alter the magnitude of cilia forces, but not their direction.
On the other hand, introducing more heterogeneous beating directionality could
alter the transport timescales as well as the directionality.
In our model, all of the applied cilia
tangential traction is aligned with the rostrocaudal axis, and more heterogeneity
in this alignment to reflect heterogeneity in the beating directionality of
cilia would presumably affect both magnitude and directionality of advective transport.
Previous studies have demonstrated that changes to beating directionality affects transport,
and that specific coordination of the ciliary beating is important in the brain ventricles for
flow and signaling processes~\cite{Eichele2020Cilia-drivenVentricle, Olstad2019CiliaryDevelopment,
Faubel2016Cilia-basedVentricles, Guirao2010CouplingCilia, Afzelius2004Cilia-relatedDiseases},
but also in other phenomena such as maintaining healthy functioning of mucous transport in
airways~\cite{Rayner1996CiliarySyndrome, Schneiter2021Multi-scaleFunction,
Bustamante-Marin2019LackClearance, Tsukita2012CoordinatedFeet} and in nodal flow which establishes
left-right symmetry in mammals~\cite{Yoshiba2014RolesSymmetry, Hirokawa2006NodalAsymmetry,
Sawamoto2006NewBrain}.
Although these studies were mostly on spatial scales resolving individual cilia,
we could envision the same effects in our continuum model,
similar to the results of previous numerical studies~\cite{Ramirez-SanJuan2020Multi-scaleArrays,
Thouvenin2020OriginCanal, Yoshida2022EffectVentricles}. 

To simulate protein transport in the brain ventricles, we numerically solved
an advection-diffusion equation. Except for where we imposed a normal pressure
boundary condition on the CSF flow,
we imposed a no-flux condition on the concentration. Imposing a pressure-driven
cardiac-related flow on certain parts of the CSF flow boundary leads to in- and outflow,
and the advective transport then requires handling of in- and outflux boundary conditions.
We set boundary conditions such that the total mass is conserved in the
limit that the timestep size is zero, reflecting our assumption that the
ventricular system is closed.
We handled the outflux by leaving the advective flux term as an unknown in the weak formulation
of the advection-diffusion equation. This has been referred to with different names
in previous works, names such as the ``free boundary condition"~\cite{Papanastasiou1992ACondition},
the ``no boundary condition"~\cite{Griffiths1997TheCondition}, and the 
``consistent flux boundary condition"~\cite{Lynch2020NumericalHemodynamics}. 
In leaving the advective flux term in the weak form we are lacking a boundary condition,
which is problematic in the continuous sense of the problem.
However, the discrete problem is well-posed, because the approach represents
constraining higher-order derivatives of the concentration~\cite{Griffiths1997TheCondition}. 

Our approach can be interpreted as an approximate periodic boundary condition, where we set
the inflow boundary flux at timestep $n$ equal to the outflow boundary flux at the previous
timestep $n-1$. This is expected to be of low-order accuracy, and for high Péclet numbers,
the boundary condition affects the concentration field in the vicinity of the
in- and outflow boundaries
due to large advective fluxes. For the simulation scenarios we considered,
both in terms of model parameters
and time span, the photoconversion region where solute originates
is far enough away from the in- and outflow
boundaries for the flux boundary condition to not significantly impact the results. Nevertheless,
we deliberately excluded the space proximal to in- and outflow boundaries in
the anterior and posterior regions of interest (5 and 6) to limit adverse effects. 

A possible improvement to the in- and outflow boundary conditions we employed would be
to consider a 3D-0D coupling of the in- and outflow boundaries using
ordinary differential equations,
similar to what has been done in cardiac
modeling~\cite{Brown2024AMechanics, Augustin2021ACirculation}.
However, if the ventricular system in reality is a closed system,
one should rather seek out a way of modeling the CSF flow without open boundaries to avoid
handling in- and outflow boundary conditions. A more appropriate way of handling the beating
cardiac motion could be to impose a ventricular wall deformation, assumed to result from pulsatile
motion of the heart and/or cardiac vessels surrounding the ventricles. This wall deformation would
induce CSF flow while simultaneously permitting enforcement of the impermeability condition
$\uu\cdot\nn=0$ on the ventricular walls. Such wall-motion induced CSF flow has been modeled and
simulated successfully in the human brain ventricular system~\cite{Causemann2022HumanFramework,
Kurtcuoglu2005ComputationalSystem, Kurtcuoglu2007ComputationalSylvius, Linninger2005PulsatileBrain}.

\subsection{Estimation of computational model parameters}
The diffusion coefficients used in this study were partially based on values
from experiments and partially estimated. The value $D_3=\num{1.15e-10} \ \mathrm{m^2/s}$
is based on the value $\num{1.15e-10} \pm 0.11 \ \mathrm{m^2/s}$ reported in an
experiment~\cite{GuraSadovsky2017MeasurementExpansion}, while the Stokes-Einstein
relation~(\Cref{eq:D_stokes_einstein})~\cite{Einstein1905UberTeilchen} was used to extrapolate
the value of $D_2$ and estimate the value of $D_1$, based on experimental
data~\cite{Swaminathan1997PhotobleachingDiffusion, Potma2001ReducedCells,
Mahmood2023ExosomeTemperature}. The Stokes-Einstein relation assumes the diffusing
substance is of spherical shape, which proteins are not, and the relation does not
necessarily hold in CSF. Moreover, the extrapolation implies the assumption that
the two substances (the one for which we determine $D$ and the one we extrapolate from)
have equal densities. Consequently, there is uncertainty in the diffusion coefficient values used.
We note that Sadovsky~\emph{et al.}~\cite{GuraSadovsky2017MeasurementExpansion} reported that
Dendra2 satisfies the Stokes-Einstein in the solution they used,
a solution which had similar viscosity
to water. We used CSF density and viscosity values measured in
humans~\cite{Bloomfield1998EffectsFluid},
and because embryonic CSF in zebrafish is high in proteins, nutrients and other substances,
the CSF in which photoconverted Dendra2 are transport in our experiments may be more viscous
than what we consider. This would reduce the diffusion coefficient (cf.~\Cref{eq:D_stokes_einstein}),
but based on reports of protein concentration having a limited impact on the viscosity of
CSF~\cite{Bloomfield1998EffectsFluid, Brydon1995PhysicalViscosity}, this reduction is presumably
limited. Merely the presence of other proteins and nutrients may also reduce the diffusion
coefficient by reduction of mean-free path lengths of molecules~\cite{Cussler2009Diffusion:Systems}.
Considering the diffusion coefficients $D_1$ and $D_2$ (both smaller
than $D_3$) in our transport analysis provides information about how the simulation
results of Dendra2 transport would be altered if the
diffusion coefficient $D_3$ is overestimated. In the case that $D_3$ is
underestimated, we assume the
results would follow the same trend as the differences between results for
$D_2$ and $D_3$: diffusion becomes
more important, and is almost balancing advective transport for $D_3$. 
Thus for a higher diffusion coefficient, we would see transport that is
mostly explained by diffusive behavior.

We heuristically determined the parameter $\tau = 0.65$ mPa, which determines
the magnitude of the cilia tangential traction boundary conditions. The maximum force applied
was in the dorsal region of the middle ventricle, where the posterior region had a tangential
traction vector magnitude of $\vert\btau\vert_{\mathrm{max}} = 2.5$ mPa applied to the
boundary. Previous simulation studies of cilia-mediated flow in brain ventricles have
used a volumetric force density to represent the cilia.
Siyahhan~\emph{et al.}~\cite{Siyahhan2014FlowVentricles}
used a force expression that increased linearly from the wall to a maximum force density of
$f_{\mathrm{max}} = 526$ N/$\mathrm{m^3}$ at a distance 15 \textmu m away from the wall,
which represented cilium length. If we assumed a cilia array of the same thickness
$l = 15$ \textmu m in our model, our maximum traction parameter $\vert\btau\vert_{\mathrm{max}}$
would correspond to a maximum force density of 
\begin{equation*}
    f_c = \frac{\vert\btau\vert_{\mathrm{max}}}{l}
        = \frac{\num{2.5e-3} \ \mathrm{Pa}}{15 \ \mu\mathrm{m}}
        = 169 \ \mathrm{N/m^3},
\end{equation*}
which is smaller than $f_{\mathrm{max}}$, albeit the same order of magnitude.
The length 15 \textmu m is the a typical length of cilia in human brain ventricles
(in general the length is between 10--15 \textmu m~\cite{Afzelius2004Cilia-relatedDiseases}),
while in zebrafish they are closer to 5 \textmu m~\cite{Salman2022ComputationalEmbryo}.
With $l=5$ \textmu m, our traction parameter corresponds to a maximum force density of
$f_c=507$ N/$\mathrm{m^3}$, which is in good agreement with
$f_{\mathrm{max}} = 526$ N/$\mathrm{m^3}$
used by Siyahhan~\emph{et al.}~\cite{Siyahhan2014FlowVentricles}.
We note that they based $f_{\mathrm{max}}$ on reconstructions of
flow velocities in murine brain ventricles.

Another study that used a force density to model ciliary motion is
Thouvenin~\emph{et al.}~\cite{Thouvenin2020OriginCanal}, where two-dimensional flow
in the central canal of zebrafish embryos was modeled using a cilia force density of
4000 N/$\mathrm{m^2}$. The resulting numerical velocity fields matched well with
in vivo measurements, where the maximum velocity magnitude was around 5 \textmu m/s
(recall that our model exhibits a maximum of 27.7 \textmu m/s).
The geometry they studied resembles a pipe, probably offering more flow resistance
than the open geometry considered in our work, which may be why they needed a larger
force density to accurately represent experimental results. In any case, it is
interesting to note that our and these two previous studies have estimated
cilia force densities that only differ by one order of magnitude. 

\subsection{Numerical approximation and convergence rates}
The Brezzi-Douglas-Marini and discontinuous Galerkin discretization scheme
($\mathrm{BDM}_1$-$\mathrm{DG}_0$) that we employ for the Stokes equations
is computationally more expensive than a more conventional approach based on
e.g. Taylor-Hood discretization~\cite{Stenberg1990ErrorProblem}
($P_2-P_1$ elements) or lower-order enriched
elements~\cite{Brezzi2011MixedMethods},
such as the mini-element ($P_1-P_1$ with a velocity stabilization).
Here, $P_k$ is the space of continuous Lagrange polynomials of degree less
than or equal to $k$.
We opted for the BDM-DG scheme because of its exactly-mass-conserving property,
since numerical experiments proved that a divergence-free velocity field was
fundamental to attain a stable discretization of the advection-diffusion equation
in advection-dominated regions. Using conventional
Taylor-Hood elements for the Stokes equations
stability of the advection-diffusion discretization either
required excessive mesh refinement and/or problem-specific tuning of
hyperparameters when employing a Streamline-Upwind/Petrov Galerkin stabilization
method~\cite{Franca1992StabilizedModel}, which is why we also opted for a DG method
for the advection-diffusion equation.
Probing numerical values of the divergence of
the velocity when using Taylor-Hood elements for the fluid equations revealed that,
on the standard computational mesh, the $L^2$ norm of $\nabla\cdot\uu_h$ was
in the order of $10^{-6}$, while the
maximum value of the divergence of the velocity was of order unity. This is a result
of the fact that incompressibility is only achieved in a (global) weak sense when
employing Taylor-Hood elements. On a refined mesh with roughly six times as many
computational cells as the standard mesh, the numerical values of
$\normltwo{\nabla\cdot\uu_h}$ and $\normlinf{\nabla\cdot\uu_h}$ were still
of order unity. This may lead to the
hyperbolic advective term in the advection-diffusion equation accumulating errors
that grow unstable over time. 

In addition to its favorable mass-conserving property, the BDM-DG scheme
lets us impose the impermeability condition strongly, and the tangential
traction boundary condition weakly, without any tailored approach,
since these boundary conditions appear naturally in the weak form of the
Stokes equations~(\Cref{subsec:appendixA1}). If instead e.g. Taylor-Hood
elements were to be used, the impermeability boundary condition must
be handled with for example a Nitsche method~\cite{Nitsche1971UberSind}
or with a Lagrange multiplier~\cite{Babuska1973TheMultipliers,
Bertoluzza2017BoundaryHemodynamics}.

A priori error estimates for the $\mathrm{BDM}_k$-$\mathrm{DG}_{k-1}$ scheme are naturally 
derived in a mesh-dependent broken $H^k$-norm for $\uu$ and the $L^2$-norm for the pressure.
The respective error norms are expected to decay with order $k$~\cite{Cockburn2005AEquations}.
For the sake of simplicity,~\Cref{tab:cylinder_error_rates}
reports the velocity errors in the standard $H^k$ norm. Using polynomial degree  
$k=1$, we observe linear convergence in both the velocity and the pressure.   
\mk{MK: I see 1.5 in the table for $\uu$ in $L^2$?}
\lyng{HH: Yes, we should expect 2 there? Maybe be more specific in the comment:
"Using polynomial degree $k=1$, we observe linear convergence in both the velocity $H^1$ error
and the pressure $L^2$ error. For the $L^2$ error of the velocity, we observe a suboptimal
convergence order of 1.5"}

\subsection{The role of motile cilia in intraventricular flow and transport}
Our work has studied CSF flow and solute distribution
in a relatively small and simple brain model, which is devoid of
active CSF secretion and CSF absorption. Even though there is
a clear conservation of the ventricular system across vertebrates,
there are also important considerations to take. These include (but are not limitied to)
ventricular size and morphology, properties of ciliated cells,
animal posture, and magnitude of velocities. For instance, a large
volume would require an extensive amount of time for solutes to distribute
if based solely on diffusion. Besides, the presence of multiple cilia
instead of a single cilium per cell -- the former can be found in
mammalian ependymal cells -- will generate much stronger velocities.
Hence advection may be more dominant in those situations.
However, in large brains such as the human brain, cilia beating will
only contribute to flow in localized regions of very high proximity to the ventricular walls,
while blood vessel pulsations, respiration and CSF secretion will generate a
pulsatile bulk flow in the central regions of the ventricles~\cite{Siyahhan2014FlowVentricles}.
Based on this, cilia probably play an important role in regulating the
amount of substances close to the ventricular walls, similar to coral
reefs, where it has been observed that cilia are primary regulators of
oxygen amounts at the coral surface~\cite{Pacherres2022CiliaryProduction}.
But for zebrafish embryos, the ventricles are so small that the flow
generated by ciliary motion is of the scale of the geometry, and thus not
only contributes to near-wall flow dynamics, but flow in the entire ventricular system.
To date, motile-cilia deficiency has been associated with altered brain function
in the zebrafish and ventricular enlargement in zebrafish, rodents and humans.
Yet the molecular mechanisms leading to these alterations are poorly understood.
We trust that our model sets the basis for future work addressing these open questions.
We are also confident that our model can be adjusted and implemented to fit
microscopic and macroscopic parameters for larger brains, once these parameters are acquired.


\lyng{HH: Refer to Eichele et al. article discussion about role of cilia.}

\subsection*{Limitations and further work}
The model presented has certain limitations. Future work could consider:
\begin{itemize}
    \item spatial heterogeneity of the cilia, how this affects flow and transport
    \item time-varying cilia?
    \item improved advection-diffusion equation BCs
    \item Modeling deformation of the ventricles
    and investigating how the arising flow compares with pulsatile flow observed in experiments
    \item FSI: CSF flow coupled to 1D/2D/3D cilia structures.
\end{itemize}

\fixme{Based on our conclusion that advection drives transport of larger proteins, could
we make some bold claims about advective transport of exosomes/extracellular vesicles in the
ventricles, and the importance of this?}

\section{Conclusion}
We have presented a numerical model
of cerebrospinal fluid flow and solute transport in
zebrafish brain ventricles based on finite element methods.
A realistic brain ventricles geometry from medical imaging was used to perform a
computational study with the presented model. The flow model reproduces
the experimentally observed flow features of cilia-mediated cerebrospinal fluid
flow in zebrafish brain ventricles. Coupling the flow to the transport model,
we estimated how slowly or rapidly molecules of varying size are transported in
the ventricles. Simulations indicate that cilia-driven advection is important
for transport of larger molecules. 
The numerical model was validated with experiments, measuring the movement of
a photoconverted fluorescent protein in zebrafish brain ventricles,
both for healthy animals and mutant animals with ciliary dysfunction.
We observed good alignment between computational and experimental results.
Experimental results indicate that cilia only affect the local distribution of small proteins,
while most of the transport is governed by diffusion.

\section{Supplementary Theory}
\subsection{Weak formulation of the Stokes equations}\label{subsec:appendixA1}
We consider the time-dependent Stokes equations
\begin{subequations}
\begin{alignat}{2}
   \rho\pdifft{\uu} - \nabla \cdot \bsig(\uu, p)
   &= \mathbf{0} \quad &&\mathrm{in} \ \Omega, \label{eq:BDM_stokes_mom}\\
  \nabla \cdot \uu &= 0 \quad &&\mathrm{in} \ \Omega, \label{eq:BDM_stokes_div} 
\end{alignat}
\label{eq:appendix_stokes_eqs}% 
\end{subequations}%
in the domain $\Omega$ with boundary $\Gamma$, where
$\bsig(\uu, p) = 2\mu\beps(\uu) - p\mathbf{I}$ is the viscous
stress tensor, in which $\beps(\uu) = \frac{1}{2}(\nabla\uu + (\nabla\uu)^T)$
is the symmetric gradient. Furthermore, $\uu\in\VV$ is the fluid velocity
and $p\in Q$ is the fluid pressure, and $\rho$ and $\mu$ are the fluid density
and dynamic viscosity, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, we let $\bsig = \bsig(\uu, p)$. 

To derive weak formulations of the continuous problem defined by the Stokes
equations~\Cref{eq:appendix_stokes_eqs}, we consider the function space
\begin{align*}
    \VV &= \bigg\{\vv \ : \ \vv\in\mathbf{H}^1(\Omega),
    \vv\cdot\nn=0 \ \mathrm{on} \ \Gamma\setminus\Gp\bigg\},
\end{align*}
for the velocity and $Q=L^2(\Omega)$ for the pressure.
Here $\Gp$ is the anterior/posterior boundary where we impose a normal pressure
boundary condition for the model versions that consider fluid motion induced by
cardiac pulsations. Bold-faced characters for a space denotes a $d$--dimensional vector space,
where $d$ is the spatial dimension of $\Omega$. For example,
$\mathbf{H}^1(\Omega) = [H^1(\Omega)]^3$ if $\Omega$ is three-dimensional.

To derive a weak formulation of the Stokes equations~\Cref{eq:appendix_stokes_eqs},
we begin by multiplying~\Cref{eq:BDM_stokes_mom} with a
test function $\vv\in\VV$ and integrating over the domain:
\begin{equation*}
    \intO{\rho\pdifft{\uu}\cdot\vv} - \intO{(\nabla\cdot\bsig)\cdot\vv} = \mathbf{0}.
\end{equation*}
Performing integration by parts of the stress term and applying Green's first identity, we get
\begin{equation}
    \intO{\rho\pdifft{\uu}\cdot\vv}
    - \intG{\bsig\nn\cdot\vv}
    + \intO{2\mu\beps(\uu) : \beps(\vv)}
    - \intO{p\nabla\cdot\vv} = \mathbf{0}, \label{eq:modelA_weak_form1}
\end{equation}
where the symbol : signifies the matrix inner product,
$A:B=\text{trace}{(A^TB)}$ for matrices $A, B\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$. 

Further steps depend on the boundary conditions applied,
which is different for the three model versions we consider in this paper.
Before proceeding, let us introduce some notation used in defining the
slip boundary conditions. We make use of a decomposition
of any vector $\vv$ on the boundary $\Gamma$ into its normal and tangential components,
$\vv = \vv_{\perp} + \vv_{\parallel}$, where $\vv_{\perp}=(\vv\cdot\nn)\nn$ and
$\vv_{\parallel}=P_{\nn}(\vv)$. The tangential projection is defined as
\begin{equation}
    P_{\nn}(\vv) = (\mathbf{I} - \nn\otimes\nn)\vv,
    \label{eq:projection_operator_appendix}
\end{equation}
where $\nn$ is the outer unit normal of the surface. Introducing
$\hat{\bsig} = \bsig\nn$ for the traction (vector), the forcing due
to cilia is represented by constraining $\bsigpar$ on the part of the
boundary populated by cilia. In particular, we let
$\bsigpar = \btau(\xx, \rr) = \tau\lambda(\xx) P_{\nn}(\rr)$,
where the parameter $\tau=\num{6.5e-4}$ Pa was used to control the magnitude
of the tangential stresses, and chosen by calibrating simulated velocity
fields with experimental data~\cite{Olstad2019CiliaryDevelopment}.
The details of the function $\lambda(\xx)$ follow subsequent to deriving the weak form.

We choose $\mathbf{r} = \rr^+ = (1, 0, 1)$ or $\mathbf{r} = \rr^- = -(1, 0, 1)$
to impose forces perpendicular to the $y$-axis.
The reason for this is that all of the experimental images we compare
with are taken in the $xz$-plane,
rendering flow features in the $y$-direction unobservable.
In the following, we consider the way of handling the stress
boundary integral for each model version successively. 

\textbf{Only-cilia/no-cardiac model.} This model version has cilia forces
as the only mechanism driving flow. We consider the
Stokes equations~\Cref{eq:appendix_stokes_eqs} with the slip boundary conditions
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{alignat}{2}
        \uu\cdot\nn &= 0 \quad &&\mathrm{on} \ \Gamma=\Gc\cup\Gs,
        \label{eq:modelA_slip_BC_impermeability} \\
        \bsigpar &= \btau \quad &&\mathrm{on} \ \Gc,
        \label{eq:modelA_slip_BC_shear} \\
        \bsigpar &= \mathbf{0} \quad &&\mathrm{on} \ \Gs,\label{eq:modelA_full_slip_BC}
    \end{alignat}\label{eq:modelA_slip_BC}%
\end{subequations}%
on the boundary $\Gamma=\Gc\cup\Gs$. The boundary $\Gs$ is a free-slip boundary,
where we impose the free-slip condition~\Cref{eq:modelA_full_slip_BC}.
The first condition~\Cref{eq:modelA_slip_BC_impermeability} is the
impermeability condition, enforcing no flow normal to the boundary,
whereas~\Cref{eq:modelA_slip_BC_shear} imposes a stress tangential to
the boundary. These tangential stresses are applied to represent
the forces that the collective cilia motion exerts on the cerebrospinal fluid. 

The boundary conditions~\Cref{eq:modelA_slip_BC} are set weakly through the stress
boundary integral 
\begin{equation}
    \intG{\bsig\nn\cdot\vv} =  \intG{\hat{\bsig}\cdot\vv}
    \label{eq:boundary_integral_BC1}
\end{equation}
in the weak form~\Cref{eq:modelA_weak_form1} of the Stokes equations.
We decompose the traction vector $\hat{\bsig}$ into a normal and tangential component:
\begin{equation*}
    \hat{\bsig} = \bsigperp + \bsigpar
\end{equation*}
Inserting the above into~\Cref{eq:boundary_integral_BC1},
combined with application of the tangential traction
condition~\Cref{eq:modelA_slip_BC_shear} and the
free-slip condition~\Cref{eq:modelA_full_slip_BC}, yields
\begin{equation}
    \intG{\hat{\bsig}\cdot\vv} = \int_{\Gc\cup\Gs}{(\bsigperp + \bsigpar)\cdot\vv}\, ds = 
    \int_{\Gc\cup\Gs}{\bsigperp\cdot\vv}\, ds
    + \intGc{\btau\cdot\vv} = \intG{\bsigperp\cdot\vv} + \intGc{\btau\cdot\vv}.
    \label{eq:boundary_integral_BC2}
\end{equation}
The second term on the right-hand side of~\Cref{eq:boundary_integral_BC2}
is moved to the right-hand side of the weak form, since $\btau$ is known
 Using $\hat{\bsig}_{\perp} = (\hat{\bsig}\cdot\nn)\nn$,
 we can write the first term on the right-hand side of~\Cref{eq:boundary_integral_BC2} as
\begin{equation}
    \intG{\bsigperp\cdot\vv} = \intG{((\hat{\bsig}\cdot\nn)\nn)\cdot\vv} =
    \intG{(\hat{\bsig}\cdot\nn)(\vv\cdot\nn)}.
    \label{eq:boundary_integral_BC_normal}
\end{equation}
Since $\Gp=\emptyset$ in this model version, and the term~\Cref{eq:boundary_integral_BC_normal}
vanishes owing to the construction $\VV$. As a result, for the cilia-only/no-cardiac model,
the weak form of the momentum equation takes the following form:
\begin{equation*}
    \intO{\rho\pdifft{\uu}\cdot\vv}
    + \intO{2\mu\beps(\uu) : \beps(\vv)}
    - \intO{p\nabla\cdot\vv} = \intGc{\btau\cdot\vv}, \quad\forall\vv\in\VV.
\end{equation*}
Next, multiplying the continuity equation~\Cref{eq:BDM_stokes_div}
with a test function $q\in Q$, we require that
\begin{equation}
    -\intO{q\nabla\cdot\uu} = 0,\quad\forall q\in Q
    \label{eq:pressure_weak_form}
\end{equation}
The full weak form of the Stokes equations for this flow model is then:
find $(\uu, \, p) \in \VV\times Q$, such that
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{alignat}{5}
        &\intO{\rho\pdifft{\uu}\cdot\vv}
        + &\intO{2\mu\beps(\uu) : \beps(\vv)}
        - &\intO{p\nabla\cdot\vv}
        &&= \intGc{\btau\cdot\vv}, &&\quad\forall\vv\in\VV, \label{eq:stokes_weak_mom_modelA}\\ 
        &{} &{}  -&\intO{q\nabla\cdot\uu} &&= 0, &&\quad\forall q\in Q.
        \label{eq:stokes_weak_cont_modelA}
    \end{alignat}%
    \label{eq:stokes_weak_modelA}%
\end{subequations}%
We observe that, in this case with slip boundary conditions on the entirety of
the boundary $\Gamma$, the vector $(\uu, p)=(\mathbf{0}, C)$ for any real
constant $C$ satisfies the equations.
The system~\Cref{eq:stokes_weak_modelA} is thus singular with a one-dimensional nullspace
of constant pressures.
Consequently, assembly of our discretization of the  equations~\Cref{eq:stokes_weak_modelA}
into a linear equation system $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ yields a singular matrix $\mathbf{A}$.
To ensure existence of solutions, we orthogonalize the right-hand side vector $\mathbf{b}$ with
respect to the pressure nullspace basis (the set of all constants), before solving the linear
system. To obtain a unique solution, which together with existence renders the
problem well-posed, information of the pressure nullspace is passed to the linear solver.
Let us remark that the singularity is a consequence of the fact that the
impermeability condition is assumed to hold on the \emph{entire} domain boundary
for this model version, which leaves the pressure under-determined as a result of no
boundary condition specifying the pressure.

The tangential traction $\btau = \tau\lambda(\xx) P_{\nn}(\rr)$ that represents the cilia
motion differ for the cilia regions. We heuristically determined the constant $\tau= 0.65$ mPa
and the spatially varying function $\lambda(\xx)$. The definitions of $\rr$ and $\lambda(\xx)$
for the different cilia populations are summarized in~\Cref{tab:r_vector_and_lambda_function}.

\textbf{Only-cardiac/no-cilia model.} For this model version,
the only physical mechanism inducing fluid flow is the cardiac cycle.
We model the influence of the cardiac cycle with a normal pressure boundary condition:
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{alignat}{2}
      \uu\cdot\nn = 0, \ \hat{\bsig}_{\parallel} &= \mathbf{0} \quad &&\mathrm{on} \ \Gs,
      \label{eq:modelB_slip_BC} \\
      (\mu\nabla\uu - p\mathbf{I})\nn &= \Tilde{p}(t)\nn \quad &&\mathrm{on} \ \Gp,
      \label{eq:modelB_pressure_BC}
    \end{alignat}%
\end{subequations}%
where the boundary $\Gamma = \Gs\cup\Gp$ consists of a free-slip boundary $\Gs$,
and a part $\Gp$ where a normal traction type of boundary condition is imposed.
Note, however, that the transpose velocity gradient term must be
included inside the parentheses on the left-hand side of~\Cref{eq:modelB_pressure_BC}
for it to be the traction $\bsig$. Since this is not the case,
we rather refer to this boundary condition as a normal pressure boundary condition.
The boundary $\Gs$ is handled as discussed in the previous section,
such that the stress boundary integral~\Cref{eq:boundary_integral_BC1}
vanishes over $\Gs$. Therefore, we now have
\begin{align}
    \intG{\hat{\bsig}\cdot\vv} = \intGp{\hat{\bsig}\cdot\vv}
    &= \intGp{(\mu(\nabla\uu + (\nabla\uu)^T) - p\mathbf{I})\nn\cdot\vv}\notag \\
    &= \intGp{\mu(\nabla\uu)^T\nn\cdot\vv} + \intGp{(\mu\nabla\uu
    - p\mathbf{I})\nn\cdot\vv}\notag\\
    &= \intGp{\mu(\nabla\uu)^T\nn\cdot\vv} + \intGp{\Tilde{p}(t)(\vv\cdot\nn)}
    \label{eq:modelB_boundary_integral1}
\end{align}
We leave the first term on the left-hand side
of~\Cref{eq:modelB_boundary_integral1} in the weak form of
the momentum equation. The second term is determined by
the boundary condition~\Cref{eq:modelB_pressure_BC},
and is therefore moved to the right-hand side of the weak form.
The weak form of the momentum equation is then
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    \intO{\rho\pdifft{\uu}\cdot\vv} + \intO{2\mu\beps(\uu) : \beps(\vv)} -
    \intO{p\nabla\cdot\vv} &-\intGp{\mu(\nabla\uu)^T\nn\cdot\vv} \\
    &=\intGp{\Tilde{p}(t)(\vv\cdot\nn)}, \quad\forall\vv\in\VV.
    \end{aligned}
    \label{eq:weak_form_mom_eq_modelB}
\end{equation}
Also considering the weak form of the continuity equation,
the weak formulation for the cardiac-only/no-cilia model version
then reads: find $(\uu,\, p)\in\VV\times Q$
such that~\Cref{eq:weak_form_mom_eq_modelB} and~\Cref{eq:pressure_weak_form}
hold for all $(\vv, \, q)\in\VV\times Q$.
To simulate the back-and-forth motion induced by the cardiac cycle observed in
previous work~\cite{Olstad2019CiliaryDevelopment}, we apply sinusoidal forcing.
The boundary $\Gp$ has two separate regions: one located on the
anterior ventricle and one on the posterior ventricle~(\Crefpanels{fig:fig1}{d}, blue markers).
For the normal pressure boundary condition, we set $\Tilde{p}(t) = 0$ on the anterior part and
$\Tilde{p}(t) = p_c(t) = -A\sin{\omega t}$ on the posterior part. The value of the amplitude
$A$ was based on heuristics and $\omega = 2\pi f$, where $f=2.22$ Hz
is the cardiac cycle frequency. 

\textbf{Baseline model.} The baseline flow model
considers both cilia and cardiac beating as driving mechanisms of fluid flow.
We therefore consider the boundary conditions
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{alignat}{2}
      \uu\cdot\nn = 0, \ \bsigpar
      &= \btau  \quad &&\mathrm{on} \ \Gc, \label{eq:slip_BC_modelC} \\
      \uu\cdot\nn = 0, \ \bsigpar
      &= \mathbf{0}  \quad &&\mathrm{on} \ \Gs, \label{eq:freeslip_BC_modelC} \\
      (\mu\nabla\uu - p\mathbf{I})\nn
      &= \Tilde{p}(t)\nn \quad &&\mathrm{on} \ \Gp, \label{eq:pressure_BC_modelC}
    \end{alignat}
\end{subequations}%
where $\Gamma = \Gc\cup\Gs\cup\Gp$ is the boundary of $\Omega$.
The quantities $\btau$ and $\Tilde{p}(t)$ have been introduced in
the previous sections covering the other flow model versions. We handle the boundary
conditions~\Cref{eq:slip_BC_modelC} and~\Cref{eq:freeslip_BC_modelC}
as introduced for the cilia-only/no-cardiac model, and the boundary
condition~\Cref{eq:pressure_BC_modelC} as introduced for the cardiac-only/no-cilia model.
The abstract weak formulation for 
the baseline model is then: find $(\uu,\, p)\in\VV\times Q$ such that
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{alignat}{2}
        \mathcal{A}(\uu, \vv) + \mathcal{B}(\vv, p) &= \mathcal{L}(\vv),
        &&\quad\forall\vv\in\VV, \\
        \mathcal{B}(\uu, q) &= 0, &&\quad\forall q\in Q,
    \end{alignat}%
    \label{eq:abstract_weak_form_modelC}
\end{subequations}%
with the definitions
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{A}(\uu, \vv) &= \intO{\rho\pdifft{\uu}\cdot\vv}
                          + \intO{2\mu\beps(\uu) : \beps(\vv)}
                          -\intGp{\mu(\nabla\uu)^T\nn\cdot\vv},\label{eq:stokes_bilinear_form}\\
    \mathcal{B}(\uu, q) &= -\intO{q\nabla\cdot\uu}, \label{eq:stokes_skew_form}\\
    \mathcal{L}(\vv) &= \intGc{\btau\cdot\vv} + \intGp{\Tilde{p}(t)(\vv\cdot\nn)}.
    \label{eq:stokes_linear_form}
\end{align}

\subsection{Discretization of the Stokes equations}
We will outline the discretization of the weak
formulation~\Cref{eq:abstract_weak_form_modelC,
eq:stokes_bilinear_form,eq:stokes_skew_form,eq:stokes_linear_form}
of the Stokes equations for the baseline model. A similar approach can
be used to discretize the weak formulation for the other model versions.
First, we consider the spatial discretization of the weak formulation.
We rewrite the weak form in terms of the discretized variables,
denoted with the subscript $h$, on the discrete domain $\Omega_h$:
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{alignat}{2}
        \mathcal{A}(\uu_h, \vv_h) + \mathcal{B}(\vv_h, p_h)
        &= \mathcal{L}(\vv_h), &&\quad\forall\vv_h\in\VV_h, \\
        \mathcal{B}(\uu_h, q_h) &= 0, &&\quad\forall q_h\in Q_h.
    \end{alignat}%
    \label{eq:no_stabilization_abstract_discrete_weak_form_modelC}%
\end{subequations}%
Our choice of discretization are finite elements
of the Brezzi-Douglas-Marini (BDM) family~\cite{Brezzi1985TwoProblems, Nedelec1986AIR3}
for the velocity
space and discontinuous Lagrange polynomial elements for the pressure. We refer to the latter
as discontinuous Galerkin (DG) elements. We define
\begin{align*}
    {\VV}_h &= \Big\{\vv_h : \vv_h\in\mathbf{H}(\mathrm{div});
    \vv_h\vert_K\in\big[P_k\big]^d;
    \forall K\in\Omega_h;
    \vv_h\cdot\nn=0 \ \text{on } \Gamma\setminus\Gp\Big\},\\
    Q_h &= \Big\{q_h : q_h\in L^2;  q_h\vert_K\in P_{k-1}; \forall K\in\Omega_h\Big\},
\end{align*}
where $P_k$ is the space of polynomials of degree less than or equal to $k$.
The BDM family of elements have degrees of freedom
associated with integral moments of vector components normal to facets of the mesh,
and is therefore non-conforming. However, the BDM-DG is $\mathbf{H}(\mathrm{div})$
conforming and thus exactly mass-conserving, because the continuity equation can be satisfied
in every computational mesh cell due to the fact that $\nabla\cdot\VV_h\subset Q_h$.
Moreover, control of normal components of $\uu_h$ conveniently 
lets us enforce the impermeability condition $\uu_h\cdot\nn=0$ strongly.
requires a stabilization of the bilinear form $\mathcal{A}(\uu_h, \vv_h)$.

Because the elements of $\VV_h$ define the normal components of $\uu_h$,
continuity in tangential components of $\uu_h$ on interior facets of
the mesh is ensured through stabilization
of the discrete weak form~\Cref{eq:no_stabilization_abstract_discrete_weak_form_modelC}.
We apply the stabilization outlined in Hong~\emph{et al.}~\cite{Hong2016AEquations}.
First, we define the average and jump operators, respectively, as
\begin{equation*}
    \avg{\uu} = \frac{\uu^+\cdot\nn^+ - \uu^-\cdot\nn^-}{2}
    \qquad\mathrm{and}\qquad \jump{\uu} = \uu^+ - \uu^-,
\end{equation*}
where $\nn$ is the normal vector on a facet separating two cells,
where the plus and minus signs denote variables in each of the two cells.
The normal vector is chosen such that it points towards the exterior of
its corresponding cell. On the boundary, the operators are defined as
$\avg{\uu} = \uu\cdot\nn$ and $\jump{\uu} = \uu$,
with $\nn$ pointing to the exterior of the domain. We now define
and add the bilinear form
\begin{align*}
    \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{stab}}(\uu_h, \vv_h) &=
    \sum_{f\in \mathcal{F}}\int_f{2\mu\frac{\gamma}{\avg{h}}\jump{P_{\nn}(\uu_h)}
    \cdot\jump{P_{\nn}(\vv_h)}}\\
    &-\sum_{f\in \mathcal{F}}\int_f{2\mu\avg{\beps(\uu_h)}\cdot\jump{\vv_h}}
    -\sum_{f\in \mathcal{F}}\int_f{2\mu\avg{\beps(\vv_h)}\cdot\jump{\uu_h}}
\end{align*}
to the discrete weak formulation~\Cref{eq:no_stabilization_abstract_discrete_weak_form_modelC},
where $\mathcal{F}$ is the set of all interior facets of the computational mesh.
The parameter $\gamma>0$ penalizes jumps in the tangential components of the velocity
across facets, whereas $h$ is the cell diameter of a mesh cell,
defined as the maximal distance between two points in a cell.
The semi-discrete weak formulation of the Stokes equations reads:
find ($\uu_h, p_h$)$\in$($\VV_h, Q_h$) such that
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{alignat}{2}
        \mathcal{A}(\uu_h, \vv_h)
        + \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{stab}}(\uu_h, \vv_h)
        + \mathcal{B}(\vv_h, p_h)
        &= \mathcal{L}(\vv_h), &&\quad\forall\vv_h\in\VV_h, \\
        \mathcal{B}(\uu_h, q_h) &= 0, &&\quad\forall q_h\in Q_h.
    \end{alignat}%
    \label{eq:abstract_semi_discrete_weak_form_modelC}%
\end{subequations}%
We solved~\Cref{eq:abstract_semi_discrete_weak_form_modelC}
numerically with the penalty parameter $\gamma=10$.

In time, we discretize the weak formulation~\Cref{eq:abstract_semi_discrete_weak_form_modelC}
with the implicit Euler method.

\subsection{Weak formulation of the advection-diffusion equation}
\label{subsec:adv_diff_eq_weak_form}
Recall the strong form of the advection-diffusion equation:
\begin{equation}
    \pdifft{c} + \nabla\cdot\JJ = 0 \quad\mathrm{in} \ \Omega,
    \label{eq:adv_diff_strong_DG}
\end{equation}
where $\Omega$ is the domain with boundary $\Gamma$, and the total solute flux
\begin{equation*}
    \JJ(c) = c\uu - D\nabla c.
\end{equation*}
We consider $\JJ = \JJ(c)$, unless otherwise indicated.
The concentration $c\in W$ and the cerebrospinal fluid velocity $\uu\in\VV$.
The weak form of~\Cref{eq:adv_diff_strong_DG} is derived by
multiplying the equation with a test function $\phi \in W$ and integrating over the domain: 
\begin{equation*}
    \intO{\pdifft{c}\phi} + \intO{(\nabla\cdot\JJ)\phi} = 0.
\end{equation*}
Integrating the second term by parts and applying Green's first identity yields
\begin{equation}
    \intO{\pdifft{c}\phi} + \intG{(\JJ\cdot\nn)\phi}
    - \intO{\JJ\cdot\nabla\phi} = 0.\label{eq:adv_diff_weak_formA1}
\end{equation}
The boundary integral of the total flux is handled differently for
the three different model versions, depending on the boundary conditions considered.

\textbf{Only-cilia/no-cardiac model.} We consider $\Omega$ to be
a closed domain with impermeable walls, setting $\JJ\cdot\nn=0$ on $\Gamma$.
The weak form is then reduced to
\begin{equation*}
    \intO{\pdifft{c}\phi} - \intO{\JJ\cdot\nabla\phi} = 0, \quad\forall\phi\in W.
\end{equation*}
Defining the left-hand side as the bilinear form
\begin{equation*}
    a(c, \phi) = \intO{\pdifft{c}\phi} - \intO{\JJ\cdot\nabla\phi}, 
\end{equation*}
we get the following abstract weak formulation: find $c\in W$ such that
\begin{equation*}
    a(c, \phi) = 0, \quad\forall\phi\in W.
\end{equation*}

\textbf{Only-cardiac/no-cilia model.} When using the normal pressure
boundary condition~\Cref{eq:modelB_pressure_BC} to model pulsatile flow,
we have in- and outflow of cerebrospinal fluid and thus advection of
$c$ on the pressure boundary $\Gp$.
Let $\Gp=\Gin\cup\Gout$ and $\Gamma = \Gnf\cup\Gin\cup\Gout$, with 
\begin{align*}
    \Gin  &= \Big\{\xx\in\Gamma : \uu(\xx, t)\cdot\nn(\xx) < 0 \Big\}, \\
    \Gout &= \Big\{\xx\in\Gamma : \uu(\xx, t)\cdot\nn(\xx) > 0 \Big\},
\end{align*}
as in- and outflow boundaries, respectively, where we have emphasized that
both $\uu$ and $\nn$ are spatially dependent variables.
With $\JJ\cdot\nn=0$ on the no-flux boundary $\Gnf$, we have
\begin{equation*}
    \intG{(\JJ\cdot\nn)\phi} = \intGin{(\JJ\cdot\nn)\phi} + \intGout{(\JJ\cdot\nn)\phi}. 
\end{equation*}
For the outflow boundary integral over $\Gout$, we impose zero
diffusive flux $D\nabla c\cdot\nn=0$,
with the advection term $c(\uu\cdot\nn)$ simply left in the variational form as an unknown.
For the continuous problem this is problematic, since we are lacking a boundary
condition to close the problem. 
In the discrete setting, however, this method of leaving the boundary term has been shown
to yield consistent results~\cite{Papanastasiou1992ACondition, Lynch2020NumericalHemodynamics,
Griffiths1997TheCondition}. Intuitively, one can think of this outflow boundary condition as
setting the advective flux to being the one consistent with the weak form,
for which there is a unique $c$ satisfying the equations, with $\uu$ determined by
the Stokes equations. 

The flux integral over the inflow boundary $\Gin$ cannot be handled
in the same way as the method used for $\Gout$, as this would not preserve
coercivity of the weak form. Lacking experimental data both for the magnitude and
origin of an inflow boundary flux, we deal with the inflow boundary in an explicit
way that resembles an approximation of a periodic boundary condition. At a timestep $n$,
when solving the linear system for the concentration $c^{n+1}$ at the next timestep $n+1$,
we set the inflow flux $h_{\mathrm{in}}^{n+1} = h_{\mathrm{out}}^{n}$, where the
latter is the outflow flux
\begin{equation*}
    h_{\mathrm{out}}^{n} = \JJ^n\cdot\nn = (c^n\uu^n - D\nabla c^n)\cdot\nn
\end{equation*}
at the previous timestep. In the limit that the timestep $\Delta t\to 0$, we would be imposing
\begin{equation*}
    \intGin{(\JJ\cdot\nn)} = \intGout{(\JJ\cdot\nn)},
\end{equation*}
which means no mass would be added to the system except for at the injection site,
which is desired as we endeavor to model the ventricles as a closed system.

Using the introduced approaches of handling the in- and outflow boundaries,
the resulting abstract weak formulation for the cardiac-only/no-cilia model is:
find $c\in W$ such that

    a(c, \phi) + b(c, \phi) = L(\phi), \quad\forall\phi\in W, \label{eq:adv_diff_weak_formB}
\end{equation}
with the definitions

\end{align}

\textbf{Baseline model.} Since both free-slip and cilia tangential
traction boundaries have the same no-flux boundary condition
in the advection-diffusion equation, the weak formulation of
the advection-diffusion equation for the baseline model is
identical to that of the cardiac-only/no-cilia model,
defined by~\Cref{eq:adv_diff_weak_formB,eq:adv_diff_skew_form,eq:adv_diff_linear_form}.

\subsection{Discretization of the advection-diffusion equation}
We outline the discretization of the advection-diffusion weak formulation
for the baseline model, defined
by~\Cref{eq:adv_diff_weak_formB,eq:adv_diff_skew_form,eq:adv_diff_linear_form}.
The weak formulation is discretized with a symmetric interior-penalty method using
discontinuous Galerkin finite elements~\cite{Arnold1982AnElements}.
Let the subscript $h$ denote discrete variables. Exchanging the
variables in~\Cref{eq:adv_diff_weak_formB} with their discrete
counterparts yields the discrete weak form: find $c_h\in W_h$ such that
\begin{equation*}
    a(c_h, \phi_h) + b(c_h, \phi_h) = L(\phi_h), \quad\forall\phi_h\in W_h.
\end{equation*}
The space $W_h$ is constructed with finite elements with
discontinuous Lagrange polynomial basis functions:
\begin{equation}
    W_h = \Big\{w_h : w_h\in L^2;  w_h\vert_K\in P_k; \forall K\in\Omega_h\Big\}.
\end{equation}
These elements allow for discontinuities in the discrete solution across element edges.
To ensure a stable discretization with these elements, we add the stabilization
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        a_{\mathrm{stab}}(c_h, \phi_h)
        = &\sum_{f\in \mathcal{F}}\int_f{D\frac{\alpha}{\avg{h}}\jump{c_h}\cdot\jump{\phi_h}}
        +\sum_{f\in \mathcal{F}}\int_f{\jump{\phi_h}\cdot\jump{c_h \hat{u}_h}}  \\
         -&\sum_{f\in \mathcal{F}}\int_f{D\avg{\nabla\phi_h}\cdot\jump{c_h}}
         -\sum_{f\in \mathcal{F}}\int_f{D\avg{\nabla c_h}\cdot\jump{\phi_h}},
    \end{aligned}\label{eq:SIP_stabilization}
\end{equation}
to the discrete weak formulation, where
\begin{equation*}
    \hat{u}_h = \frac{1}{2}\left(\uu_h\cdot\nn + \vert\uu_h\cdot\nn\vert\right)
\end{equation*}
is used to upwind the velocity $\uu_h$, with the velocity upwinded with respect to a
facet $\mathcal{F}_k$. The stabilization parameter $\alpha>0$ must be chosen
large enough to achieve stability. The average and jump operators used
in~\Cref{eq:SIP_stabilization} are defined, respectively, as
\begin{equation*}
    \avg{c} = \frac{c^+ + c^-}{2} \qquad\mathrm{and}\qquad \jump{c} = c^+\nn^+ + c^-\nn^-.
\end{equation*}
The final discrete weak formulation of the advection-diffusion equation is:
find $c_h\in W_h$, such that
\begin{equation}
    a(c_h, \phi_h) + a_{\mathrm{stab}}(c_h, \phi_h) + b(c_h, \phi_h) = L(\phi_h),
    \quad\forall\phi_h\in W_h.
    \label{eq:discrete_weak_form_adv_diff}
\end{equation}
In this work, we solved~\Cref{eq:discrete_weak_form_adv_diff} numerically
with the penalty parameter value $\alpha=25$.

In time, we discretized~\Cref{eq:discrete_weak_form_adv_diff} with the implicit Euler method.

\section{Verification}\label{sec:appB_verification}
\subsection{Method of Manufactured Solutions}\label{subsec:mms}
Let $\hat{\xx} = (\hat{x}, \hat{y}, \hat{z}) = \frac{1}{L}(x, y, z)$
be the spatial coordinates scaled by the length $L$, which is the length of
the computational domain $\Omega$ in the $x$-direction. Letting $\bm{\phi}$ be
the vector-valued function
\begin{equation*}
    \bm{\phi} = \left(\sin{(\pi(\hat{x} - \hat{y}))},
    \sin{(\pi(\hat{y} + \hat{z}))},
    \sin{(\pi(\hat{x} - \hat{z}))}\right)
\end{equation*}
and defining the velocity as 
\begin{equation}
    \uu_{\mathrm{mms}} = \nabla\times\bm{\phi},
    \label{eq:velocity_mms}
\end{equation}
we have by construction that the velocity is divergence-free,
owing to the identity $\nabla\cdot(\nabla\times\bm{F}) = 0$ for
an arbitrary vector field $\bm{F}$. The pressure was defined as
\begin{equation}
    p_{\mathrm{mms}} = \cos{(\pi(\hat{x} + \hat{y} + \hat{z}))}.
    \label{eq:pressure_mms}
\end{equation}
Using the Method of Manufactured Solutions~\cite{Roache2001CodeSolutions},
we construct a problem with the Stokes equations where~\Cref{eq:velocity_mms}
and~\Cref{eq:pressure_mms} are the solutions.
To this end, we consider the general form of the steady Stokes equations
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        -\nabla\cdot\bsig &= \ff \qquad\mathrm{in \ }\Omega,\\
        \nabla\cdot\uu &= g \qquad\mathrm{in \ }\Omega,
    \end{align}
    \label{eq:stokes_mms}%
\end{subequations}%
with $\bsig(\uu, p) = 2\mu\beps(\uu) - p\mathbf{I}$ and
$\beps(\uu) = \frac{1}{2}\left(\nabla\uu + (\nabla\uu)^T\right)$, and the boundary condition
\begin{alignat}{2}
    \uu &= \uu_{\mathrm{mms}} \qquad&&\mathrm{on \ }\Gamma,
\end{alignat}
where $\Gamma=\partial\Omega$ is the boundary of the domain.
Since the velocity field~\Cref{eq:velocity_mms} is divergence free by construction,
$g = 0$. Setting the external force $\ff=-\nabla\cdot\bsig(\uu_{\mathrm{mms}}, p_{\mathrm{mms}})$
using~\Cref{eq:velocity_mms} and~\Cref{eq:pressure_mms},
the solutions $\uu$ and $p$ to~\Cref{eq:stokes_mms} will be the ones
defined by~\Cref{eq:velocity_mms} and~\Cref{eq:pressure_mms},
as long as we enforce equality in the mean pressures, i.e. $\intO{(p_h - p_{\mathrm{mms}})}=0$.
Convergence rates are then readily calculated by comparing the numerical approximations of
$\uu$ and $p$ with $\uu_{\mathrm{mms}}$ and $p_{\mathrm{mms}}$
on meshes of varying grid resolution.

\subsection{Norms and convergence order}\label{subsec:norms_and_eoc}
Errors of the velocity $\uu_h$ and pressure $p_h$ approximated with finite elements
were measured in the $\mathbf{H}^1$ and $L^2$ error norms, respectively.
With the exact velocity field $\uu_{\mathrm{ex}}$, the $\mathbf{H}^1$
error norm was calculated as
\begin{equation*}
    \Hnorm{\uu_h - \uu_{\mathrm{ex}}}^2
    = \intO{\nabla(\uu_h - \uu_{\mathrm{ex}}) : \nabla(\uu_h - \uu_{\mathrm{ex}})}.
\end{equation*}
The $L^2$ error norms for the pressure were calculated as
\begin{equation*}
    \normltwo{p_h - p_{\mathrm{ex}}}^2 = \intO{(p_h - p_{\mathrm{ex}})^2}.
\end{equation*}
The approximated functions were interpolated onto elements in a space of piecewise-continuous
Lagrange polynomials of three polynomial degrees higher than the elements used to approximate
the functions, meaning that polynomial degrees 5 and 4 were used for the velocity and pressure
errors, respectively. Numerical integration was performed with a Gauss quadrature rule,
with the quadrature rule degree equal to the polynomial degree of the integrated
finite element functions. 

Convergence rates reported in~\Cref{subsec:numerical_verification} were
approximated in the following way. Define the error $e_k$ for a given mesh
resolution $h_k$. Based on the assumption that the error scales as
$e_k \approx C{h_k}^l$, where $C$ is a constant independent of $h_k$,
the convergence order $l$ was approximated as
\begin{equation}
    l = \frac{\log{(e_k/e_{k+1}})}{\log{(h_k/h_{k+1}})}.
    \label{eq:convergence_order_estimate}
\end{equation}
Consider a finite element function 
\begin{equation*}
    \phi = \phi_i\psi_i(\xx)
\end{equation*}
with basis functions $\psi_i$, where $i$ are the degrees of freedom and Einstein
summation is employed.
The infinity norm of $\phi$ was approximated from the vector
of coefficients $\left\{\phi_i\right\}$, which represent point evaluations of $\phi$ as
\begin{equation*}
    \normlinf{\phi} = \max_i{\vert \phi_i\vert}.
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Numerical verification of model implementation}\label{subsec:numerical_verification}
A cylinder geometry meshed with varying degrees of refinement was used to
perform convergence analysis of the numerical methods used to solve the Stokes equations.
The cylinder had unit length and a diameter of one half length unit.
For the analysis, we used tangential traction boundary conditions on all
of the cylinder surface. Using the Method of Manufactured Solutions~\cite{Roache2001CodeSolutions}
with the velocity and pressure expressions defined in~\Cref{subsec:mms}
for $\uu_{\mathrm{ex}}$ and $p_{\mathrm{ex}}$, we calculated $\mathbf{L}^2$
and $\mathbf{H}^1$ error norms for $\uu_h$, and the $L^2$ error norm for
$p_h$~(\Cref{tab:cylinder_error_rates}). Based on the error norm calculations,
we also calculated the experimental order of convergence~(\Cref{subsec:norms_and_eoc}).
We observe convergence in all of the reported error norms. Furthermore,
we report the error in calculation of the maximum velocities, and observe
convergence in this error as well. Lastly, we calculated the $L^2$ norm of
the divergence $\nabla\cdot\uu_h$ to verify the property of mass conservation.

    for mesh refinement on a cylinder mesh with the only-cilia/no-cardiac flow model.
    Additionally, we report the $L^2$ norm of the divergence of the velocity.
    For all error norms, convergence rates calculated
    with~\Cref{eq:convergence_order_estimate} are given

To verify the model implementation with the zebrafish brain ventricles mesh,
we compared velocity norms for varying degrees of refinement of the brain ventricles
mesh~(\Cref{tab:ventricles_norms_BDM}).
For all meshes, we report the maximum discrete velocity magnitude $\normlinf{u_h}$.
For a velocity vector $\uu=(u_x, u_y, u_z)$, the velocity magnitude is
$u = \sqrt{u_x^2 + u_y^2 + u_z^2}$. We also report the maximum value
$\normlinf{u_h}$ scaled by the area $|\Gc|=\intGc{}$ over which tangential traction
$\btau$ was applied. We chose this measure using $|\Gc|$ as a scale because the regions
of the mesh marked as cilia-populated changes slightly with every mesh refinement,
owing to the unstructured organization of the mesh cells. This change in the surface
area over which the tangential traction was applied directly affected
the maximum velocity magnitude,
since the maximum velocity magnitude is a result of the total amount of force
$\intGc{\btau\cdot P_{\nn}(\rr)}$ applied on the ciliated boundary, where the cilia
vector $\btau = \tau\lambda(\xx) P_{\nn}(\rr)$ as introduced in~\Cref{subsec:appendixA1}.
In the numerical experiments, we set a constant $\tau = 6.5\times 10^{-4}$ Pa and
$\lambda(\xx)=1$. We set $\rr = (1, 0, 1)$ in the ventral middle ventricle cilia region
and $\rr = -(1, 0, 1)$ in the dorsal middle ventricle and the anterior ventricle cilia
regions. We used $\gamma=10$ for the BDM penalty parameter.

To account for the fact that the volume $|\Omega|=\intO{}$ also changes
slightly with mesh refinement, we report the $\mathbf{L}^2$ norm of $\uu_h$ scaled by $|\Omega|$.
Finally, we provide verification of mass conservation by reporting the $\mathbf{L}^2$ norms of
the divergence $\nabla\cdot\uu_h$. We remark that the units used in the model
implementation was millimeters, which is why~\Cref{tab:ventricles_norms_BDM}
reports units in millimeters, instead of micrometers which has been used elsewhere in the paper.

\section{Quantification of velocities in particle tracking}\label{sec:appC_particle_transport}
Particle tracking data~\cite{Olstad2019CiliaryDevelopment} was analyzed.
For four zebrafish, five recordings with a few particles for each fish were carried out.
The particles tracked were in the duct between the rhombencephalic ventricle and the
diencephalic ventricle. Frequency of image acquisition was 20.22 Hz.
The collected data constituted $x$ and $y$ positions of the particles at every time
instant of image acquisition. The velocities $\uu_x$ and $\uu_y$ were determined by
calculating the change in positions $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$ relative to the change
in time $\Delta t$ between two subsequent images, $\Delta t$ being equal to the
frequency of acquisition.
Mean velocities $\overline{u}_x$~(\Crefpanels{fig:particle_tracking_data}{a}) and
$\overline{u}_y$~(\Crefpanels{fig:particle_tracking_data}{b}),
which serve as a quantification of particle drift, were calculated
by taking the difference between the last and first positions of a particle.

Particle movement varied over the different measurements. The mean of $\overline{u}_x$ was
0.26 \textmu m/s and the mean of $\overline{u}_y$ was 0.08 \textmu m/s.
The maximum mean velocities
in absolute values were 10.2 \textmu m/s and 2.4 \textmu m/s for
$\overline{u}_x$ and $\overline{u}_y$,
respectively. We used the only-cardiac/no-cilia flow model to tune the
pressure boundary condition
amplitude $A$. The choice of $A=0.0015$ Pa was used since: (i) it yields a
maximum velocity magnitude
of 4.8 \textmu m/s, which is close to the maximum observed in the
particle tracking data when
rejecting the outlier at around 10 \textmu m/s; (ii) it yields a time-averaged mean velocity
of 0.89 \textmu m/s, which is close to the mean observed in the particle tracking data.
