--------

The directory `standard` includes all meshes used for transport simulations.
Meshes used for verification are located in the `cylinder` and `ventricles`
folders.

The `cilia_locationsX.png` image files in this directory show the location of motile ciliated cells
on the brain ventricular surface. These images were used as motivation for
the cilia facet marking of the computational meshes.

The file `brainventricles.png` shows an example of ventricular geometries over
the course of development.
